<p class="noindent">I had intended this record of personal adventure to
appear immediately after my return to Europe, in May
1859. The impaired health, the depression of spirits,
and worse still the annoyance of official correspondence,
which to me have been the sole results of African
Exploration, may be admitted as valid reasons for the
delay.</p>

<p>In April, 1860, the Royal Geographical Society of
Great Britain honoured me by publishing a detailed paper,
forming the XXIXth Volume of their Journal, from
which the topographical descriptions contained in the
following pages have, with their kind permission, been
extracted. I have now attempted to combine with
geography and ethnology, a narrative of occurrences
and an exposition of the more popular and picturesque
points of view which the subject offers.</p>

<p>When I communicated to my friends the publishers
certain intentions of writing an exclusively “light work,”
they protested against the project, stating that the
public appetite required the addition of stronger meat.
In compliance, therefore, with their suggestion, I have
drawn two portraits of the same object, and mingled
the gay with the graver details of travel, so as to
produce an antipathetic cento.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-viii">[viii]</span></p>

<p>Modern “hinters to travellers” direct the explorer
and the missionary to eschew theory and opinion. We
are told somewhat peremptorily that it is our duty to
gather actualities not inferences&mdash;to see and not to think,
in fact, to confine ourselves to transmitting the rough
material collected by us, that it may be worked into
shape by the professionally learned at home. But why
may not the observer be allowed a voice concerning his
own observations, if at least his mind be sane and his
stock of collateral knowledge be respectable?</p>

<p>I have not attempted to avoid intruding matters of a
private and personal nature upon the reader; it would
have been impossible to avoid egotism in a purely egotistical
narrative. The official matter, however, has been
banished into Appendix II. In publishing it, my desire
is to avoid the possibility of a charge being concealed
in the pigeon-holes of the India House, to be produced,
according to custom, with all the effect of a surprise
whenever its presence is convenient. I know the conditions
of appealing from those in office to a higher tribunal&mdash;the
Public. I well know them and I accept
them. <i>Avant tout, gentilhomme!</i></p>

<p>I have spoken out my feelings concerning Captain
Speke, my companion in the Expedition which forms
the subject of these pages. The history of our companionship
is simply this:&mdash;As he had suffered with
me in purse and person at Berberah, in 1855, I
thought it but just to offer him the opportunity of renewing
an attempt to penetrate into Africa. I had no
other reasons. I could not expect much from his assistance;
he was not a linguist&mdash;French and Arabic
being equally unknown to him&mdash;nor a man of science,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-ix">[ix]</span>
nor an accurate astronomical observer. The Court of
Directors officially refused him leave of absence; I obtained
it for him by an application to the local authorities
at Bombay. During the exploration he acted in a
subordinate capacity; and as may be imagined amongst
a party of Arabs, Baloch, and Africans, whose languages
he ignored, he was unfit for any other but a subordinate
capacity. Can I then feel otherwise than indignant,
when I find that, after preceding me from Aden to
England, with the spontaneous offer, on his part, of not
appearing before the Society that originated the Expedition
until my return, he had lost no time in taking
measures to secure for himself the right of working the
field which I had opened, and that from that day he has
placed himself <i>en evidence</i> as the <i>primum mobile</i> of an
Expedition, in which he signed himself “surveyor,”&mdash;<i>cujus
pars minima fuit</i>?</p>

<p>With deference to the reader’s judgment, I venture
to express a hope that whatever of unrefinement appears
in these pages, may be charged to the subject.
It has been my duty to draw a Dutch picture, a cabaret-piece
which could not be stripped of its ordonnance, its
boors, its pipes, and its pots. I have shirked nothing
of the unpleasant task,&mdash;of recording processes and not
only results; I have entered into the recital of the maladies,
the weary squabbles, and the vast variety of
petty troubles, without which the <i>coup d’œil</i> of African
adventure would be more like a Greek Saint in effigy&mdash;all
lights and no shade&mdash;than the chapter of accidents
which it now is.</p>

<p>The map and the <a href="#Pagei-xi">lists of stations, dates, &amp;c.</a>, have
been drawn upon the plan adopted by Mr. Francis
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-x">[x]</span>
Galton, F.R.G.S. The outline of Africa, the work of Mr.
Weller, F.R.G.S., contains the latest and the best information
concerning the half-explored interior of the
Continent. The route-map has been borrowed by
permission from the laborious and conscientious compilation
of Mr. Findlay, F.R.G.S., accompanying the
paper forwarded by me to the Royal Geographical
Society. The latter gentleman has also kindly supplied
a profile of the country traversed, showing the Eastern
limits of the Great Depression, and the “elevated-trough
formation” of Central Africa.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would solicit forbearance in all that
concerns certain errors of omission and commission
scattered through these pages. The migratory instinct
is now hurrying me towards the New World: I have,
therefore, been obliged to content myself with a single
revise.</p>

<p class="noindent">At noon, on the 16th of June, 1857, the corvette Artémise,
after the usual expenditure of gunpowder which must in
Eastern lands announce every momentous event, from
the birth of a prince to the departure of a bishop, slowly
gliding out of Zanzibar harbour, afforded us a farewell
glance at the whitewashed mosques and houses of the
Arabs, the cadjan-huts, the cocoa-grown coasts, and the
ruddy hills striped with long lines of clove. Onwards
she stole before a freshening breeze, the balmy breath of
the Indian Ocean, under a sun that poured a flood of
sparkling light over the azure depths and the bright
green shallows around, between the “elfin isles” of Kumbeni,
with its tall trees, and Chumbi, tufted with dense
thickets, till the white sandstrip mingled with the blue
ocean, the gleaming line of dwarf red cliff and scaur
dropped into the water’s edge, the land faded from emerald
to brown, and from brown to hazy purple, the tufts
of the trees seemed first to stand out of, then to swim
upon, the wave, and as evening, the serenest of tropical
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-2">[2]</span>
evenings, closed in over sky, earth, and sea, a cloud-like
ridge, dimly discernible from our quarter, was all that
remained of Zanzibar.</p>

<p>I will not here stay the course of my narrative to
inform the reader that Zanzibar is not, as the Cyclopædias
declare, “an island of Africa, governed by a
king who is subject to the Portuguese;” that it is not,
as the Indian post-offices appear to believe, a part of
the Persian Gulf; nor, as homekeeping folk, whose notions
of African geography are somewhat dim and ill-defined,
have mentally determined, a rock in the Red
Sea, nor a dependency of the Niger, nor even an offshoot
of the Cape of Storms.</p>

<p>The Artémise is a kind of “Jackass-frigate,” an 18-gun
corvette, teak-built in Bombay, with a goodly
breadth of beam, a slow sailer, but a sure. In the days
of our deceased ally, Sayyid Said, the misnamed “Imaum
of Muscat,” she had so frequently been placed by his
Highness at the disposal of his old friend Lieut.-Colonel
Hamerton, that she had acquired the sobriquet of “the
Balyuz or Consul’s yacht.” On this occasion she had
been fitted up for a cruise to the mainland; her yards,
usually struck, had been swayed up and thrown across;
her top spars had been transferred from the hold to their
proper place; her ropes and rigging, generally hanging
in tatters about her sticks, had been carefully overhauled;
her old sails had been bent, and her usual
crew, a few slaves that held their own with difficulty
against a legion of rats and an army of cockroaches, had
been increased to its full complement of twenty men.
His Highness the Sayyid Majid, who after the demise of
his father had assumed the title of “Sultan of Zanzibar
and the Sawahil,” came on board accompanied by his
four brothers, of whom two&mdash;Sayyids Jamshid and Hamdan&mdash;died
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-3">[3]</span>
of small-pox before our return, and one&mdash;Sayyid
Barghash&mdash;has lately become a state prisoner at
Bombay, to bid what proved a last adieu to his father’s
friend. At the same time His Highness honoured me,
through his secretary, Ahmed bin Nuuman, more generally
known as Wajhayn, or “Two-faces,” with three
letters of introduction, to Musa Mzuri, the Indian doyen
of the merchants settled at Unyamwezi, to the Arabs
there resident, and to all his subjects who were travelling
into the interior.</p>

<p>The Artémise conveyed the <i>personnel</i> and the <i>matériel</i>
of the East African Expedition, namely, the two
European members&mdash;my companion and myself&mdash;two
Portuguese, or rather half-caste Goanese “boys,” two
Negro gun-carriers, the Seedy Mubarak Mombai (Bombay),
and Muinyi Mabruki, his “brother,” and finally, eight
so-called “Baloch” mercenaries, a guard appointed by
the Sultan to accompany me. Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton,
at that time Her Majesty’s consul and Hon. East India
Company’s agent at Zanzibar, though almost lethargic
from the effects of protracted illness&mdash;he lived only in
the evening&mdash;had deemed it his duty to land us upon
the coast, and to superintend our departure from the
dangerous seaboard. He was attended by Mr. Frost, the
apothecary attached to the consulate, whose treatment
for a fatal liver-complaint appeared to consist of minute
doses of morphia and a liberal diet of sugar.</p>

<p>By Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton’s advice, I ventured
to modify the scheme of the East African Expedition, as
originally proposed by the Expeditionary Committee of
the Royal Geographical Society of London. In 1855,
M. Erhardt, an energetic member of the hapless “Mombas
Mission,” had on his return to London offered to
explore a vast mass of water, about the size of the Caspian,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-4">[4]</span>
which, from the information of divers “natives,”
he had deposited in slug or leech shape in the heart of
Intertropical Africa, thus prolonging the old “Maravi,” or
“Moravim Lake” of Portuguese travellers and school
atlases, to the north of the equator, and thus bringing
a second deluge upon sundry provinces and kingdoms
thoroughly well known for the last half century. He
had proposed to land, with an outfit of 300 dollars<a id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>,
at Kilwa, one of the southern ports of the Zanzibar
mainland, to hire a score of Wasawahili porters, to
march with a caravan upon the nearest point of his
own water, and to launch an adventurous canoe upon
a lake which, according to his map, could not be traversed
under twenty-five days. Messrs. Erhardt and
Krapf, of the “Mombas Mission,” spent, it is true, a
few hours at Kilwa, where they were civilly entreated by
the governor and the citizens; but they egregiously deceived
themselves and others, when they concluded that
they could make that place their ingress-point. Lieut.
Christopher, I.N., who visited the East African coast in
1843, wisely advised explorers to avoid the neighbourhood
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-5">[5]</span>
of Kilwa. Wisely, I repeat: the burghers of that
proud old settlement had, only a year before my arrival,
murdered, by means of the Wangindo savages, an Arab
merchant who ventured to lay open the interior.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
The sum was wholly inadequate. M. Erhardt has, I have been told, expended
as much on a week’s march from Pangani Town to Fuga. The smallest
of Wasawahili pedlars would hardly deem an outfit of 300 dollars sufficient.
M. Erhardt was, even according to his own reduced ideas of distance, to march
with twenty followers 400 miles, and to explore a lake 300 miles in breadth
and of unknown length. In 1802, when cloth and beads were twice their
present value in Africa, the black Pombeiros sent by M. Da Costa, superintendent
of the “Cassangi Factory,” carried with them for the necessary
expenses and presents, goods to the value of nearly 500<i>l.</i> M. Erhardt’s
estimate was highly injurious to future travellers: either he knew the truth,
and he should have named at once a reasonable estimate, or he was ignorant
of the subject, and he should have avoided it. The consequence of his proposal
was simply this:&mdash;With 5000<i>l.</i> instead of 1000<i>l.</i>, the limited sum of the
Government grant, the East African Expedition could have explored the
whole central area; nothing but the want of supplies caused their return at
the time when, after surmounting sickness, hardship, and want of discipline
amongst the party, they were ready to push to the extreme end.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>At the same time I had laid before the Council of the
Royal Geographical Society my desire to form an expedition
primarily for the purpose of ascertaining the limits
of the “Sea of Ujiji, or Unyamwezi Lake,” and secondarily,
to determine the exportable produce of the interior,
and the ethnography of its tribes. I have quoted
exactly the words of the application. In these days every
explorer of Central Africa is supposed to have set out
in quest of the coy sources of the White Nile, and
when he returns without them, his exploration, whatever
may have been its value, is determined to be a failure.
The Council honoured my plans with their approval. At
their solicitation, the Foreign Office granted the sum
of 1000<i>l.</i> for the outlay of the exploration, and the defunct
Court of Directors of the late East India Company,
who could not be persuaded to contribute towards the
expenses, generously allowed me two years’ leave of
absence from regimental duty, for the purpose of commanding
the Expedition. I also received instructions
to report myself to his Excellency the Lord Elphinstone,
then Governor of Bombay, and to Lieut.-Colonel
Hamerton, from whose influence and long experience
much was expected.</p>

<p>When the starting-point came to be debated, the
Consul strongly objected to an Expedition into the interior
<i>viâ</i> Kilwa, on account of the opposition to be
expected at a port so distant from the seat of government,
where the people, half-caste Arabs and Wasawahili,
who are under only a nominal control, still retained
a strong predilection for protection, and a violent
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-6">[6]</span>
hostility to strangers. These reasons led him to propose
my landing upon the coast opposite Zanzibar, and
to my thence marching with a strong escort, despatched
by the Arab prince, through the maritime tribes, whose
cruel murder of M. Maizan, the first European known
to have penetrated beyond the sea-board, was yet fresh
in the memories of men. This notion was accepted the
more readily, as during my short preliminary sojourn
at Zanzibar, I had satisfactorily ascertained from Arab
travellers that the Maravi or Kilwa Lake is distinct from
the “Sea of Ujiji;” that the former is of comparatively
diminutive dimensions; that there is no caravan route
between the two; and therefore that, by exploring the
smaller, I should lose the chance of discovering the
larger water. Moreover, the general feeling of the
Zanzibarites&mdash;of the Christian merchants, whom I had
offended by collecting statistics about copal-digging, ivory,
and sesamum&mdash;of the Bhattias or Hindus of Cutch, who
systematically abuse the protection of the British flag to
support the interest of the slave trade&mdash;of the Arabs,
who remembered nothing but political intrigue in the explorations
of the “Mombas Mission,” and the lamentable
result of Dr. Krapf’s political intrigues&mdash;and of the
Africans generally, who are disposed to see in every
innovation some new form of evil&mdash;had been conveyed
to my ears explicitly enough to warrant my apprehensions
for the success of the Expedition, had I insisted
upon carrying out the project proposed by M. Erhardt.</p>

<p>I must here explain, that before my departure from
England, the Church Missionary Society had supplied
me, after a personal interview in Salisbury Square, with
a letter to their <i>employé</i>, M. Rebmann, the last remnant
of that establishment at Mombasah, which had, it is
said, expended about 12,000<i>l.</i> with the minimest of results.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-7">[7]</span>
The missionaries had commenced operations with
vigour, and to the work of conversion they had added
certain discoveries in the unknown lands of the interior,
which attracted the attention of European geographers.
Unhappily Dr. Krapf, the principal, happened to commit
himself by the following assertion:&mdash;“The Imaum of
Muskat has not an inch of ground on the coast between
the Island of Wassin and the Pangani River; this tract,
in fact, belonging to King Kmeri of Usumbara, down
from 4° 30′ to 5° 30′ S. The tract, which is very low,
is inhabited by the Wasegua tribes, and is the chief
slave-market for supplying Zanzibar.”</p>

<p>This “information,” put forth in the Journal of the
Royal Geographical Society (vol. i. p. 203), was copied
into the Proceedings (vol. xxiii. p. 106), with the remark,
that the territory alluded to was a “supposed
possession” of the Imaum. Orientals are thin-skinned
upon questions of land; the assertion was directly
opposed to fact, and the jealousy of the rival representatives
at Zanzibar each on his own side, exaggerated
its tendency. Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, who felt his
influence sapped by this error on the part of his protégé,
had reported the facts to his government. Dr.
Krapf had quitted the scene of his labours and discoveries,
but his Highness the Sultan and the sadat,
or court, retained a lively remembrance of the regretable
incident. Before the arrival of the Expedition,
“Muhiyy-el-Din,” the Shafei Kazi of the island, had
called upon Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, probably by direction
of his superiors, and had received an answer,
fortified by an oath, that the Expedition was wholly
independent of “Dutchmen,” as the missionaries were
called by the Zanzibarites. I was compelled, somewhat
unwillingly, to dispense with urging M. Rebmann’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-8">[8]</span>
presence. By acting in any other way I should have
lost the assistance of the consul, and the Arabs, with a
ready display of zeal, would have secured for me an inevitable
failure.</p>

<p>At six <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> on Wednesday, the 17th of June, 1857,
the Artémise cast anchor off Wale Point, a long, low
bush-grown sandspit, about eighty-four miles distant
from the little town of Bagamoyo. Our sailing-master,
Mohammed bin Khamis, anchored in deep water, throwing
out double the length of chain required. For this
prudence, however, there was some reason. The road-steads
are open; the muddy bottom shelves gradually,
almost imperceptibly; the tides retire ten or eleven feet,
and a strong gale, accompanied by the dangerous raz
de marée, or rollers from seaward, especially at the
seasons of the syzygies, with such a shore to leeward, is
justly dreaded by the crews of square-rigged vessels.</p>

<p>There is a something peculiarly interesting in the first
aspect of the “Mrima,” the hill-land, as this portion of
the African coast is called by the islanders of Zanzibar.
On one side lies the Indian Ocean, illimitable towards
the east, dimpled with its “anerithmon gelasma,” and
broken westward by a thin line of foam, creaming upon
the whitest and finest of sand, the detritus of coralline
and madrepore. It dents the coast deeply, forming
bays, bayous, lagoons, and backwaters, where, after
breaking their force upon bars and black ledges of sand
and rock, upon diabolitos, or sun-stained masses of a
coarse conglomerate, and upon strong weirs planted
in crescent shape, the waters lie at rest in the arms
of the land like sheets of oil. The points and islets
formed by these sea-streams are almost flush with the
briny surface, yet they are overgrown with a profuse vegetation,
the result of tropical suns and copious showers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-9">[9]</span>
which supply the want of rich soil. The banks of the
backwaters are lined with forests of white and red mangrove.
When the tide is out, the cone-shaped root-work
supporting each tree rises naked from the deep
sea-ooze; parasitical oysters cluster over the trunks at
water-level, and between the adults rise slender young
shoots, tipped with bunches of brilliant green. The
pure white sand is bound together by a kind of convolvulus,
whose large fleshy leaves and lilac-coloured
flowers creep along the loose soil. Where raised higher
above the ocean level, the coast is a wall of verdure.
Plots of bald old trees, bent by the regular breezes,
betray the positions of settlements which, generally
sheltered from sight, besprinkle the coast in a long
straggling line, like the suburbs of a populous city. Of
these, thirteen were counted in a space of three miles.
The monotony of green that clothes the soil is relieved
in places by dwarf earth-cliffs and scaurs of rufous hue&mdash;East
Africa is mostly a red land&mdash;and behind the foreground
of littoral or alluvial plain, at a distance varying
from three to five miles, rises a blue line of higher level,
conspicuous even from Zanzibar Island, the sandy raised
beach now the frontier of the wild men. To this sketch
add its accompaniment; by day, the plashing of the wave,
and the scream of the gull, with the perpetual hum
and buzz of insect life; and, after sunset, the deep, dead
silence of a tropical night, broken only by the roar of
the old bull-crocodile at his resting-time, the qua-qua
of the night-heron, and the shouts and shots of the
watchmen, who know from the grunts of the hippopotamus,
struggling up the bank, that he is quitting his
watery home to pay a visit to their fields.</p>

<p>We were delayed ten days off Wale Point by various
preliminaries to departure. Said bin Salim, a half-caste
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-10">[10]</span>
Arab of Zanzibar, who, sorely against his will, was
ordered by the prince to act as Ras Kafilah, or caravan-guide,
had, after ceaseless and fruitless prayers for delay,
preceded us about a fortnight, for the purpose of collecting
porters. The timid little man, whose nerves were
shaken to weeping-point by the terrors of the way, and
by the fancy that, thus cooperating with the exploration,
he was incurring the hatred of his fellows, had “taken
the shilling,” in the shape of 500 dollars, advanced
from public funds by the consul, with a promise of an
ample reward in hard coin, and a gold watch, “si se
bene gesserit:” at the same time Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton
had warned me against trusting to a half-caste.
Accompanied by a Cutch Banyan of the Bhattia caste,
by name Ramji&mdash;of whom more anon&mdash;he had crossed
over, on the 1st of June, to the main-land, and had hired
a gang of porters, who, however, hearing that their
employer was a Muzungu, a “white man,” at once
dispersed, forgetting to return their hire. About one
hundred and seventy men were required; only thirty-six
were procurable. The large amount of carriage was
necessitated by the bulky and ponderous nature of
African specie, cotton cloth, brass-wire, and beads, of
which a total of seventy loads was expended in one
year and nine months. Moreover, under the impression
that “vert and venison” abounded in the interior, I
had provided ammunition for two years,&mdash;ten thousand
copper-caps of sizes, forty boxes, each restricted, for
convenience of porterage, to forty pounds, and containing
ball, grape, and shot, six fire-proof magazines, and
two small barrels of fine powder, weighing in total fifty
pounds, together with four ten-pound kegs of a coarser
kind for the escort,&mdash;in all, two hundred rounds for
each individual of the party. This supply was deemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-11">[11]</span>
necessary on account of the immense loss to which ammunition
is subjected by theft and weather in these lands.</p>

<p>On the second day after anchoring off Wale Point, a
native boat brought on board the Artémise Ladha Damha,
the collector of customs at Zanzibar, who, in compliment
to Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, of old his friend and
patron, had torn himself from his beloved occupations
to push the departure of the Expedition. Ladha, hearing
that the Arab merchants had hastened to secure
their gangs before corrupted by the more liberal offers
of the “white men,”&mdash;“Pagazi,” or porters, being at
that time scarce, because the caravans from the interior
had not yet reached the coast,&mdash;proposed to send forward
the thirty-six fellows hired by Said bin Salim, with orders
to await the arrival of their employer at Zungomero, in
the land of K’hutu, a point situated beyond the plundering
maritime tribes. These men carried goods to the
value of 654 dollars German crowns (each 4<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>), and
they received for hire 124 dollars; rations, that is
to say, 1·50 lbs. of grain per diem, not included: they
preferred to travel with the escort of two slave-musketeers
rather than to incur the fancied danger of accompanying
a “Muzungu,” though followed by a well-armed
party. For the personal baggage and the outfit necessary
for crossing the maritime region, which reached by
waste the figure of 295 dollars, asses were proposed by
Ladha Damha: Zanzibar and the mainland harbours were
ransacked, and in a short time thirty animals, good, bad,
and indifferent, were fitted for the roads with large canvas
bags and vile Arab packsaddles, composed of damaged
gunny-bags stuffed with straw. It was necessary to
leave behind, till a full gang of porters could be engaged,
the greater part of the ammunition, the iron boat which
had proved so useful on the coasting voyage to Mombasah,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-12">[12]</span>
and the reserve supply of cloth, wire, and beads,
valued at 359 dollars. The Hindus promised faithfully
to forward these articles, and received 150 dollars for the
hire of twenty-two men, who were to start in ten days.
Nearly eleven months, however, elapsed before they appeared;
caravan after caravan came up from the coast, yet
the apathetic Bhattias pretended want of porters as the
cause of their delay. Evidently my preparations were
hurriedly made; strong reasons, however, urged me on,&mdash;delay,
even for a few days, might have been fatal.</p>

<p>During the brief detention off Wale Point, the latitudes
and longitudes of the estuary of the Kingani,
the main artery of these regions, and of the little
settlements Bagamoyo and Kaole,&mdash;strongly against the
advice of Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, who declared that
by such proceedings the Expedition was going to the
bad,&mdash;were laid down by my companion: a novice
lunarian, he was assisted by Mohammed bin Khamis, who
had read his “Norie” in England. Various visits to the
hippopotamus haunts produced little beyond the damaging
of the corvette’s gig, which, suddenly uplifted from
the water upon the points of two tusks, showed two corresponding
holes in her bottom. Nor did I neglect to
land as often as possible at Kaole, the point of departure
upon the mainland, for the purpose of making sketches
with the pen and pencil, of urging on preparations, and
of gathering those items of “bazar-gup,” <i>i. e.</i>, tittle-tattle,
that represents the labours of the “fourth
estate” in Eastern lands.</p>

<p>The little settlement of “Kaole”&mdash;an abbreviation of
Kaole Urembo, meaning literally, in the ancient dialect
of the coast, “to show beauty”&mdash;is the normal village-port
in these regions, which, from Mombasah southwards
to Kilwa, still ignore a town of masonry. You
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-13">[13]</span>
land, when the tide is out, upon half a mile of muddy
sand, and if a “swell,” you are carried by four men
upon the Kitanda&mdash;cot or cartel&mdash;which is slung
along the side of your craft. Arrived at the strip of
dry ground that marks the limit of the tide, you are let
down, and amidst the shouts of the men, the shrieks of the
women, and the naïve remarks of the juvenile population,
you ascend by a narrow footpath, worn through
the thick jungle and through the millet-fields which
press upon the tattered palisade, a dwarf steep bank, on
whose summit the settlement lies. Inside the fence are
a dozen pent-roofed houses, claret-chests of wattle and
dab, divided into three or more compartments by dwarf
party-walls of the same material: each messuage is jealously
separated from its neighbour by large enclosed
“compounds” or court-yards appropriated to the women
and children. The largest timber is that of
the mangrove; the flying thatch-roof, so raised that,
though windows are unknown, the interior enjoys
tolerable ventilation, is of jauli, or rude cocoa-plaits,
and under the long and projecting eaves, which rest
upon strong perpendiculars, are broad earth-benches,
divided by the entrance, and garnished with mats:
these form the shops and sitting-rooms of the settlement.
Some houses have a partial second story, like
a ship’s bunk, a planking supported by rafters, and
used as a store-closet or a dormitory. Around the
larger habitations cluster masses of hovels, and the
characteristic African haycock-huts. With closed doors
in still weather, these dens are unendurable to a
European; the people, however, fearing thieves and
wild beasts, never fail to barricade themselves within
at night. The only attempt at masonry in the settlement
is the “Gurayza,” or fort, a square of lime and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-14">[14]</span>
coralline, with store-rooms for the Banyan’s goods below,
and provided with a crenelled terrace for watchmen.</p>

<p>In the “garrison-towns” the soldiers and their
families form the principal part of the population.
These men, who call themselves Baloch, are, with few
exceptions, originally from Mekran, and from the
lowlands about Guadel. Many of them have been born
and bred in Arabia. In former days their fathers
migrated from their starving homes to Maskat, in the
Arab dows which visited their ports, to buy horses, and
to collect little cargoes of wheat and salt. In Arabia
they were fakirs, sailors, porters, and day-labourers,
barbers, date-gleaners, asinegos, beggars, and thieves.
Sultan Bin Hamid, the father of the late Sayyid Said,
first conceived the bright idea of putting matchlocks
into their hands, and of dubbing them Askar, or soldiers,
as a slight upon his less docile compatriots. The son
of Sultan followed his sire’s plan, and succeeded in dividing
and ruling by means of the antipathy prevailing
between the more disciplinable mercenary and the
unruly Arab subject. The Baloch are, however, rather
hated than feared. They hang, say the Semites, their
benefits behind their backs, whilst they wear their grievances
in full view, woman-like, upon their breasts. Loud
in debate, and turbulent in demeanour, they are called
by the Arabs a “light folk,” and are compared to birds
fluttering and chirruping round a snake. Abject slaves
to the Great Gaster, they collect in swarms round a
slaughtered goat, and they will feast their eyes for
hours on the sight of a rice-bag. When in cantonment
on the island or the coast, they receive as pay from 2·50
to 5 dollars per mensem; when in the field or on outpost
duty, a “batta” of 10 dollars;&mdash;a sensible system,
which never allows them to become, like the Indian
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-15">[15]</span>
Sepoy, independent. They are not averse to active
service, as, when so employed, they have full permission
to “pill and poll.” In camp they are commanded by a
jemadar, who, assisted by a “moollah,”&mdash;some wretch
who has retained, as sole traces of his better days, a
smattering of reading, writing, and arithmetic,&mdash;robs
them and his government with the recklessness of impunity.
Thus the jemadar, or C. O., who also dispenses
promotion, is a man having authority. Similarly our
colonels in India, by superior position and allowances,
commanded the respect of their men before centralisation,
falling upon the land like a pestilence, systematically
monopolised all power, and then rained blame upon those
who had lost it. These Baloch are a tame copy of the
Turkish Bashi Buzuk, or “mad-cap,” far inferior as desperadoes
to the Kurd and Arnaut. They live the
life of the Anglo-Indian soldier of the past generation,
drinking beer when they can “come by it,” smoking,
chatting, and arguing; the younger wrestle, shoot, and
exchange kit; and the silly babbling patriarchs, with
white beards and venerable brows, tell wondrous tales
of scenes long gone by, and describe to unbelieving ears
the ice and snow, the luscious fruits and the sweet waters
of the mountains and valleys of far Balochistan.</p>

<p>The other items of the population are the Wamrima<a id="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;Western
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-16">[16]</span>
Negroids of a mixed Arab and African descent,
who fringe the shore in a thin line. These “coast-clans”
support themselves in idleness and comparative luxury,
by amicably plundering the down-caravans, and by large
plantations of cereals and vegetables, with which they,
or rather their slaves, supply the island of Zanzibar,
and even the shores of Arabia. The Wamrima are an
ill-conditioned race; they spend life in eating, drinking,
and smoking, drinking and dancing, visits, intrigue, and
low debauchery. They might grow cotton and coffee,
and dig copal to almost any extent; but whilst a pound
of grain remains in bin, no man will handle a hoe.
The feminine part of the community is greatly superior
in number to the masculine, and this leads to the usual
result: on a “Siku ku” or fête-day, the ladies of the
village, with yellow pigment over their faces and their
woolly heads, perform in their cups impromptu-dances
upon the open, enter a stranger’s house as if it were their
own, and call for something to drink, as if they had been
educated at Cremorne, or the Rue Cadet. The Wamrima
are ruled by Diwans, or headmen, locally called “Chomwi;”
these officials are subject to Zanzibar, and their
numbers are everywhere in inverse ratio to the importance
of the places. The Chomwi enjoys the privileges of
“dash,” fines and extortions; he has also certain marks
of distinction. For instance, he is authorised to wear
turbands and the wooden pattens called by the Arabs
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-17">[17]</span>
“kabkab;” he may also sit upon cots, chairs, and the
mkeka, a fine dyed mat; whereas a commoner venturing
upon such display would infallibly be mulcted in goats
or cattle. At the Ngoma Ku or great dance, which
celebrates every event in this land of revelry, only the
Chomwi may perform the morris with drawn sword
before the admiring multitude. A subject detected in
intrigue with the wife of a headman must, under penalty
of being sold, pay five slaves; the fine is reduced to one
head in the case of a plebeian. With this amount of dignity
the Diwan naturally expects to live, and to support his
family with the fat of the land, and without sweat of
brow. When times are hard, he organises a kidnapping
expedition against a weaker neighbour, and fills his
purse by selling the proceeds. But his income is derived
chiefly from the down-caravans bringing ivory and
slaves from Unyamwezi and the far interior. Though
rigidly forbidden by the Prince of Zanzibar to force
caravans to his particular port, he sends large armed
parties of his kinsmen and friends, his clients and serfs,
as far as 150 and 200 miles inland, where they act less
like touters than highwaymen. By every petty art of
mercantile diplomacy,&mdash;now by force, then by fraud,
by promises, or by bribes of cloth and sweetmeats,&mdash;they
induce the caravan to enter the village, when the
work of plunder begins. Out of each Frasilah (thirty-five
lbs. avoirdupois) of ivory, from eight to fourteen
dollars are claimed as duties to the Government of
Zanzibar; the headmen, then, demand six dollars as
their fee, under various technical names, plus one dollar
for “ugali” or porridge&mdash;the “manche,”&mdash;and one
dollar for the use of water&mdash;the “pour boire.” The
owner of the tusk is then handed over to the tender
mercies of the Banyan, from whom the Diwan has
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-18">[18]</span>
received a bribe, called his “rice”; and the crafty
Hindu buys for eighteen to twenty dollars an article
worth, at Zanzibar, fifty. If the barbarian be so unwise
as to prefer cash, being intellectually unfit to
discriminate between a cent and a dollar, he loses even
more than if he had taken in barter the coarse and
trashy articles provided for him by the trade. An adept
at distinguishing good from bad cloth and a cunning
connoisseur in beads of sorts, he has yet no choice: if
he reject what is worthless, he must return home with
his ivory and without an investment. Such is an outline
of the present system. It is nowhere the same in
its details; but everywhere the principle is one&mdash;the
loss is to the barbarian, and the profits are to the coast-clans,
the Wamrima and their headmen. Hence the
dislike to strangers and the infinite division into little
settlements, where people might be expected to prefer
the comfort and safety of large communities. The 10th
article of the commercial treaty, concluded on the 31st
May, 1839, between Her Majesty’s Government and
His Highness Sayyid Said of Muscat and Zanzibar,
secured to the possessors of the Mrima a monopoly in
the articles of ivory and gum-copal on that part of the
east coast of Africa from the port of Tangata (Mtangata),
situated in about 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>° S. lat. to the port of Quiloa
(Kilwa) lying in about 7° S. of the equator. It is not
improbable that the jealousy of European nations, each
fearing the ambitious designs of its neighbour, brought
about this invidious prohibitionist measure.</p>

It must be borne in mind, that, in the Kisawahili and its cognates,
the vowel <i>u</i> prefixed to a root, which, however, is never used without some
prefix, denotes, through a primary idea of causality, a country or region, as
Uzaramo, the region of Zaramo. Many names, however, exceptionally omit
this letter, as the Mrima, K’hutu, Fuga, and Karagwah. The liquid <i>m</i>, or,
before a vowel and an aspirated h, <i>mu</i>, to prevent hiatus, being probably a
synæresis of <i>M</i>tu, a man, denotes the individual, as Mzaramo, a man or
woman of Zaramo. When prefixed to the names of trees, as has been instanced,
it is evidently an abbreviation of Mti, a tree. The plural form of
<i>m</i> and <i>mu</i> is Wá, a contraction of Wátu, men, people; it is used to signify the
population, as Wamrima, the “coast-clans,” Wazaramo, the people or tribe of
Zaramo, and Wasawahíli (with a long accent upon the penultimate, consonant
with the spirit of the African language, and contrary to that of the
Arabic), the population of the Sawahil. Finally, the syllable <i>ki</i>&mdash;prefixed
to the theoretical root&mdash;denotes anything appertaining to a country, as the
terminating <i>ish</i> in the word English. It especially refers in popular usage
to language, as Kizaramo, the language of Zaramo; Kisawahíli, the language
of the Sawahil, originally called Ki-ngozi, from the district of Ngozi, on the
Ozi River. It has been deemed advisable to retain these terse and concise distinctions,
which, if abandoned, would necessitate a weary redundance of words.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Besides the Baloch and the Wamrima, the settlements
usually contain a few of the “Washenzi” or barbarians
from the interior, who visit them to act as day-labourers,
and who sometimes, by evincing a little disrespect for
the difference between the “mine” and the “thine,” leave
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-19">[19]</span>
their heads to decorate tall poles at the entrance. The
Wazaramo tribe send, when there is no blood-feud, numbers
to Kaole, where they are known by their peculiar
headdress, a single or a double line of pips or dilberries
of ochre and grease surrounding the head. They regard
the stranger with a wild and childish stare, and whenever
I landed, they slunk away from me, for reasons
which will appear in the course of this narrative. The
list of floating population concludes with a few Banyans,&mdash;there
are about fifty in Kaole and its vicinity&mdash;a
race national as the English, who do their best to import
into Eastern Africa the cows and curries, the
customs and the costumes, of Western India.</p>

<p>The first visit to Kaole opened up a vista of unexpected
difficulties. My escort had been allowed to leave
the Artémise, and their comrades in arms had talked
them half-crazy with fear. Zahri, a Baloch, who had
visited Unyamwezi, declared that nothing less than 100
guards, 150 guns, and several cannon could enable them
to fight a way through the perils of the interior. Tulsi,
the Banyan, warned them that for three days they must
pass amongst savages, who sit on trees and discharge
poisoned arrows into the air with such dexterity that
they never fail to fall upon the travellers’ pate; he
strongly advised them therefore, under pain of death, to
avoid trees&mdash;no easy matter in a land all forest. Then
the principal Chomwi assured them that the chiefs of the
Wazaramo tribe had sent six several letters to the officials
of the coast forbidding the white man to enter their
country. Ladha Damha also obscurely hinted that the
Wazaramo might make caches of their provisions in the
jungle, and that the human stomach cannot march without
feeding. Divers dangers of the way were incidentally
thrown in: I learned for the first time that the Kargadan
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-20">[20]</span>
or rhinoceros kills 200 men, that armies of elephants
attack camps by night, and that the craven hyæna does
more damage than the Bengal tiger. In vain I objected
that guns with men behind them are better than cannon
backed by curs, that mortals can die but once, that the
Wazaramo are unable to write, that rations might be
carried where not purchaseable, and that powder and
ball have been known to conquer rhinoceroses, elephants,
and hyænas. A major force was against me.</p>

<p>Presently the cause of intimidation crept into sight.
The Jemadar and the eight Baloch detached by His Highness
the Sayyid Majid of Zanzibar could not march
without a reinforcement of four others, afterwards
increased by a fifth in the person of an “Ustad,” a tailor-boy.
The garrison of Kaole having no employment, was
ready, with the prospect of the almighty dollar, to march
anywhere on this side of Jehannum. The perils of the
path rendered it absolutely necessary that we should
be escorted by a temporary guard of thirty-four men
and their Jemadar Yaruk: and they did not propose
to do the good deed gratis. Ramji, the Banyan clerk
of the customs at Zanzibar, had a number of slaves
whom he called his “sons;” they were “eating off
their heads” in idleness at Zanzibar. He favoured me
by letting out ten of these youths at the rate of thirty
dollars ahead for a period of six months: for the same
sum every man might have been purchased in the
market. When asses were proposed ass-men were necessary;
in the shortest space of time five were procured,
and their pay for the whole journey was fixed at thirty
dollars, about twice the sale-value of the article. I
cannot plead guilty to not having understood the manœuvre,&mdash;a
commercial speculation on the part of the
rascal Ramji. Yet at times,&mdash;need I say it?&mdash;it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-21">[21]</span>
good to appear a dupe. It is wise, when your enemies
determine you to be that manner of sable or ermine
contrivance into which ladies insert their fair hands, to
favour the hypothesis. I engaged the men, I paid the
men, and mentally I chronicled a vow that Ramji should
in the long run change places with me.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Frost with brow severe and official
manner, informed me that the state of Lieut.-Colonel
Hamerton’s health forbade a longer stay near the coast.
To this there was no reply: I contented myself with
remarking once more that morphia appeared a curious
cure for a confirmed liver complaint, and I made preparations
for landing at once. Mr. Frost replied that
the doses of morphia were very “little ones,”&mdash;an excuse
which, according to Capt. Marryat, has been urged under
somewhat dissimilar circumstances by the frail ancilla.
I confided to Mr. Frost’s care two MSS. addressed
through the Foreign Office, one to Mr. John Blackwood,
the other to Dr. Norton Shaw, of the Royal Geographical
Society. As the former arrived in safety, whilst the
latter,&mdash;a detailed report concerning the commerce and
capabilities of Zanzibar,&mdash;was lost, I cannot help suspecting
that it came somehow to an untimely end. Lieutenant-Colonel
Hamerton had repeatedly warned me
that by making inquiries into the details of profit I was
exciting the jealousy of the natives and the foreigners
of Zanzibar. According to him the mercantile community
was adopting the plan which had secured the foul
murder of M. Maizan: the Christians had time and opportunity
to alarm the Banyans, and the latter were
able to work upon the Wasawahíli population. These
short-sighted men dreaded that from throwing open the
country, competition might result: Oriental-like, thinking
only of the moment, of themselves, they could not
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-22">[22]</span>
perceive that the development of resources would benefit
all concerned in their exploitation. There were, however,
honourable exceptions, amongst whom I am bound
to mention M. Bérard, agent to Mess. Rabaud, frères,
of Marseilles, who by direction of his employers offered
me every manner of assistance; and the late M. Sam.
Masury, a Salem merchant, to whose gratuitous kindness
I was indebted for several necessaries when separated
from civilisation by one half of Africa. They
contrasted sharply with the rest of the community:
in the case of a certain young gentleman, Lieut.-Colonel
Hamerton was,&mdash;he informed me,&mdash;compelled
to threaten a personal chastisement, unless he ceased to
fill native ears with his malignant suspicions.</p>

<p>The weary labour of verifying accounts and of writing
receipts duly concluded, I took a melancholy leave
of my warm-hearted friend Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton,
upon whose form and features death was written in
legible characters. He gave me his last advice, to march
straight ahead despising “walnut and velvet-slipper
men,” who afford opinions, and conciliating the Arabs
as much as possible. Then he spoke of himself: he
looked forward to death with a feeling of delight, the
result of his religious convictions; he expressed a hope
that if I remained at Kaole, he might be buried at sea;
and he declared himself, in spite of my entreaties, determined
to remain near the coast until he heard of our
safe transit through the lands of the dreaded Wazaramo.
This courage was indeed sublime! Such examples are
not often met with amongst men!</p>

<p>After this affecting farewell, I took leave of the Artémise
and landed definitively at Kaole. The Baloch
driving the asses were sent off to the first station on
the road westwards, headed by my companion, on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-23">[23]</span>
same evening, lest a longer sojourn in the lands of semi-civilisation
should thoroughly demoralise them. The
Wanyamwezi porters, whose open faces and laughing
countenances strongly prepossessed me in their favour,
had already passed beyond their centre of attraction,
the coast. I spent that evening with Ladha Damha, inside
the gloomy Gurayza. He lectured me for the last
time upon my development of what the French cartomantiste
calls “la bosse de la témérité.” Might not the
Sahib be a great Sahib in his own land&mdash;Cutch or Guzerat?
Are there not other great Sahibs there, A&mdash;Sahib
and B&mdash;Sahib, for instance, who only kill pigs
and ignore the debtor and creditor side of an account in
Guzeratee?</p>

<p>I must mention that, on the morning of the same
day, I was present at a conversation held by the Ladha,
the respectable collector of the customs, with the worthy
Ramji, his clerk. I had insisted upon their inserting
in the estimate of necessaries the sum required to purchase
a boat upon the “Sea of Ujiji.”</p>

<p>“Will he ever reach it?” asked the respectable Ladha,
conveying his question through the medium of Cutchee,
a dialect of which, with the inconsequence of a Hindu,
he assumed me to be profoundly ignorant.</p>

<p>“Of course not,” replied the worthy Ramji; “what
is he that he should pass through Ugogi?” (a province
about half way.)</p>

<p>At the moment I respected their “sharm,” or shame,
a leading organ in the oriental brain, which apparently
has dwindled to inconsequential dimensions amongst
the nations of the West. But when Ladha was alone, I
took the opportunity to inform him that I still intended
to cross Ugogo, and to explore the “Sea of Ujiji.” I
ended by showing him that I was not unacquainted with
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-24">[24]</span>
Cutchee, and even able to distinguish between the debits
and the credits of his voluminous sheets.</p>

<p>During the conversation, the loud wail of death rang
wildly through the grave-like stillness of night. “O
son, hope of my life! O brother, dearest of brothers!
O husband! O husband!” these were the cries which
reached our ears. We ran to the door of the Gurayza.
The only son of the venerable Diwan Ukwere, who had
been ascending the Kingani river on a mercantile expedition,
with five slaves, had been upset by a vengeful
hippopotamus, and, with two of his attendants, had lost
his life.</p>

<p>“Insaf Karo! be honest!” said the Banyan, with
whom I had had many discussions as to whether it be
lawful or unlawful to shoot the hippopotamus, “and own
that this is the first calamity which you have brought
upon the country by your presence.”</p>

<p>I could only reply with the common-places of polemics.
Why should Ladha, who by purchasing their
spoils encouraged the destruction of herds of elephants,
object to the death of a “creek-bull”? and why should
the man who would not kill the “creek-bull” be ready
to ruin a brother-man for making a better bargain
about its tusks? Ladha received these futile objections
contemptuously, as you would, right reverend father,
were I to suggest that you, primate and spiritual peer,
are not exactly following in the footsteps of certain
paupers whom you fondly deem to have been your prototypes,&mdash;your
exemplars.</p>

<p>When Ladha left, my spirits went with him. In
the solitude and the silence of the dark Gurayza, I
felt myself the plaything of misfortune. At Cairo
I had received from the East India House an order
to return to London, to appear as a witness on a
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-25">[25]</span>
trial by court-martial then pending. The missive
was, as usual, so ineptly worded, that I did not think
proper to throw overboard the Royal Geographical Society&mdash;to
whom my services had been made over&mdash;by
obeying it: at the same time I well knew what the consequences
would be. Before leaving Egypt, an interview
with the Count d’Escayrac de Lauture, had afforded me
an opportunity of inspecting an expedition thoroughly
well organised by His Highness Said Pacha, of military
predilections, and the contrast between an Egyptian and
an English exploration impressed me unpleasantly.
Arrived at Aden, I had enlisted the services of an old
and valued friend, Dr. Steinhaeuser, civil surgeon at that
station: a sound scholar, a good naturalist, a skilful
practitioner, endowed, moreover, with even more inestimable
personal qualities, his presence would have
been valuable in a land of sickness, skirmishes, and
sporting adventures, where the people are ever impressed
with the name of “medicine-man,” and in a virgin field
promising subjects of scientific interest. Yet though recommended
for the work by his Excellency the Governor
of Bombay, Dr. Steinhaeuser had been incapacitated by
sickness from accompanying me: I had thus with me a
companion and not a friend, with whom I was “strangers
yet.” The Persian war had prevented the fitting-out of
a surveying vessel, ordered by the Court of Directors
to act as a base of operations upon the African coast; no
disposable officer of the Indian navy was to be found at
the Presidency; and though I heard in Leadenhall Street
of an “Observatory Sergeant” competent to conduct the
necessary astronomical and meteorological observations,
in the desert halls of the great Bungalow at Colaba
only a few lank Hindus met my sight. Nor was this
all. His Highness the late Sayyid Said, that estimable
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-26">[26]</span>
ally of the English nation, had for many years repeatedly
made the most public-spirited offers to his friend
Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton. He was more than once
upon the point of applying for officers selected to map
the caravan routes of Eastern Africa, and he professed
himself willing to assist them with men, money, and the
weight of his widely extended influence. This excellent
prince had died forty days before the Expedition arrived
at Zanzibar. Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, also, whose extraordinary
personal qualities enabled him to perform
anything but impossibilities amongst the Arabs, was
compelled by rapidly failing health, during my stay at
Zanzibar, to lead a recluse life, which favoured the plans
of my opponents. Finally, as Indian experience taught
me, I was entering the unknown land at the fatal season,
when the shrinking of the waters after the wet monsoon
would render it a hotbed of malaria.</p>

<p>The hurry of departure, also, had caused a necessary
neglect of certain small precautions, which, taken in
time, save much after trouble. I should have shunned
to have laid down limits of space and time for the Expedition,
whereas my friend and adviser had specified
the “Sea of Ujiji.” I intended to have drawn out
every agreement in an official form, registered at the
Consulate, and specifying all particulars concerning rations
and presents for the escort, their ammunition, and
their right of sporting&mdash;that is to say, of scaring the
game before it could be shot&mdash;their reward for services,
and their punishments for ill conduct. Lieut.-Colonel
Hamerton’s state of health, however, rendered him totally
unfit for the excitement of business; and, without
his assistance, a good result was not to be expected from
measures so unfamiliar, and therefore so unpalatable, to
the people whom they most concerned.</p>

<p>Excuse, amiable reader, this lengthy and egotistical
preface to a volume of adventure. Do not think that
I would invert the moral of the Frog-fable, by showing

trivial in themselves, and all unworthy of record, yet
so far valuable, that they may enable us to understand

<p class="noindent">The history of the word Zanzibar is curious. Its
Persian origin proves that the Iranians were in early
days a more maritime people than Vincent and other
writers imagine. Zanzibar, signifying Nigritia, or
Blackland, is clearly derived from the “Zang,” in Arabic
Zanj, a negro, and “bar,” a region. This Zangbar was
changed by the Arabs, who ignore in writing the hard
<i>g</i>, into Zanjíbár; they still, however, pronounce
Zangbar, and consider it synonymous with another
popular expression, “Mulk el Zunuj,” or “the Land of
the Blacks.” Thus the poet <span class="nowrap">sings,&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Traces of the word may be found in the earliest
geographers. Ptolemy records a Zingis or Zingisa,
which, however, with his customary incorrectness, he
places north of the equator. According to Cosmas
Indicopleustes, the Indian Ocean beyond Barbaria is
called Zingium. “Sinus Barbaricus” seems to have
been amongst the Romans the name of the belt of
low land afterwards known as “Zanzibar,” and it was
inhabited by a race of Anthropophagi, possibly the
fathers of the present “Wadoe” tribe. In more modern
times the land of the Zunuj has been mentioned by a
host of authors, El Novayri and others.</p>

<div class="container" id="Illoi-3">
<img src="images/i_illo051.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A TOWN ON THE MRIMA.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-29">[29]</span></p>

<p>The limits of Zanzibar,&mdash;a word indiscriminately
applied in former times to the coast, the island, and
even to the principal town,&mdash;are variously laid down
by geographers. Usually it is made to extend from
Cape Delgado, in S. lat. 10° 41′ to the equator, or
more strictly to S. lat. 0° 15′, at the mouth of the
Vumbo, or the Webbe Ganana, which appears in our maps
under the deceptive corruptions “Juba” and “Govind,”
from the Somali “Gob,” a junction, and “Gob-wen,” a
large junction. Mr. Cooley (Inner Africa Laid Open,
p. 111) corrects the great error of the Portuguese
historian, de Barros, who has made the embouchure
of the Obi&mdash;in Somali Webbe, meaning any river,&mdash;the
demarcation line between “Ajan” on the north, and
“Zanguebar” in the south, and has placed the mouth
of that stream in 9° N. lat., which would extend Zanzibar
almost to Cape Guardafui. Asiatic authors,
according to M. Guillain, (Documents sur l’Histoire,
&amp;c. de l’Afrique Orientale. Première partie, p. 213)
vary in opinion concerning the extent of the “land
of the Zunuj” and its limits; some, as El Masudi, make
it contain the whole country, including Sofala, between
the embouchure of the Juba River (S. lat.
0° 15′) and Cape Corrientes (S. lat. 23° 48′): others,
like El Idrisi and Ibn Said, separate from it Sofala.
In local and modern usage the word Zanjibar is generally
confined to the chief town upon the island, the latter
being called by Arabs, as well as by the Negroids,
Kisiwa, “insula,” in opposition to the Barr el Moli, a
barbarised Semitic term for the continent.</p>

<p>As usual throughout these lands, where comprehensive
geographical names are no longer required,
there is no modern general word for East Africa
south of the equator. The term “Sawahil,” or “the
shores,” in present parlance is confined to the strip of
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-30">[30]</span>
coast beyond the half-Somali country, called from its various
ports,&mdash;Lamu, Brava, and Patta,&mdash;Barr el Banadir,
or Harbour-land. The “Sawahil” extend southwards to
Mombasah, below which the coast suddenly falling flat,
is known as Mrima or the Hill, and its people as
Wamrima, the “hill-men.” It is limited on the south
by the delta of the Rufiji River, whose races are
termed Watu wa Rufiji, Rufiji clans, or more shortly,
Warufiji.</p>

<p>The country properly called the Mrima has no history
beyond its name, whilst the towns immediately to the
north and south of it,&mdash;Mombasah and Kilwa,&mdash;have
filled many a long and stirring page. The Arab
geographers preceding the Portuguese conquest mention
only five settlements on the coast between Makdishu
(Magadoxo) and Kilwa, namely, Lamu, Brava, Marka,
Malindi (Melinda), and Mombasah. In Captain Owen’s
charts, between Pangani and the parallel of Mafiyah
(Monfia Island) not a name appears.</p>

<p>The fringe of Moslem Negroids inhabiting this part
of the East African coast is called by the Arabs Ahl
Maraim, and by themselves Wamrima, in opposition to
the heathen of the interior. These are designated in
mass the Washenzi&mdash;conquered or servile&mdash;properly
the name of a Helot race in the hills of Usumbara, but
extended by strangers to all the inner races. The
Wasawahili, or people of the Sawahil, Mulattos originally
African, but semiticised, like the Moplahs of Malabar,
by Arab blood, are in these days confined to the lands
lying northwards of Mombasah, to the island of Zanzibar,
and to the regions about Kilwa.</p>

<p>The Mrima is peopled by two distantly connected
families, the half-caste Arabs and the Coast-Clans. The
former are generally of Bayazi or Khariji persuasion;
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-31">[31]</span>
the latter follow the school of el Shafei; both, though
the most imperfect of Moslems, are fanatical enough to
be dangerous. They own a nominal allegiance to the
suzerain of Zanzibar, yet they are autonomous and
free-spoken as Bedouins, when removed a few miles
from the coast, and they have a rooted aversion to the
officials of the local government, whom they consider
their personal enemies. Between them and the pure
Arabs of Oman, who often traverse, but who now never
settle upon the Mrima, there is a repugnance increased
by commercial jealousy; they resent the presence of these
strangers as an intrusion, and they lose no opportunity
of thwarting and discouraging them from travelling into
the interior. Like their ancestors, they dislike Europeans
personally, and especially fear the Beni Nar, or
Sons of Fire,&mdash;the English&mdash;“hot as the Ingrez,” is in
these lands a proverb. In their many Riwayat, Hadisi,
and Ngoma&mdash;tales, traditions, and songs&mdash;they predict
the eventual conquest of the country that has once felt
the white man’s foot.</p>

<p>The half-caste Arab is degenerate in body and mind;
the third generation becomes as truly negroid as the
inner heathen. Even Creoles of pure blood, born upon
the island and the coast of Zanzibar, lose the high nervous
temperament that characterises their ancestors, and
become, like Banyans, pulpy and lymphatic. These
mestiços, appearing in the land of their grandsires, have
incurred the risk of being sold as slaves. The peculiarity
of their physiognomy is the fine Semitic development
of the upper face, including the nose and nostrils, whilst
the jaw is prognathous, the lips are tumid and everted,
and the chin is weak and retreating. The cranium is
somewhat rounded, and it wants the length of the Negroid’s
skull. Idle and dissolute, though intelligent
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-32">[32]</span>
and cunning, the coast-Arab has little education. He
is sent at the age of seven to school, where in two or
three years he accomplishes the Khitmah, or perlection
of the Koran, and he learns to write a note in an antiquated
character, somewhat more imperfect than the
Cufic. This he applies to the Kisawahili, and as nothing
can be less fitted for the Semitic tongues than the Arabic
syllabarium, so admirably adapted to its proper sphere,
his compositions require the deciphering of an expert.
A few prayers and hymns conclude the list of his acquirements.
His mother-tongue knows no books except
short treatises on Bao, or geomancy, and specimens of
African proverbial wisdom. He then begins life by
aiding his father in the shop or plantation, and by giving
himself up to intoxication and intrigue. After suffering
severely from his excesses&mdash;in this climate no constitution
can bear up against over-indulgence long continued&mdash;at
the age of seventeen or eighteen, he takes unto
himself a wife. Estranged from the land of his forefathers,
he rarely visits Zanzibar, where the restraints
of semi-civilisation, the decencies of oriental society, and
the low estimation in which the black skin is held, weary
and irritate him. His point of honour seems to consist
chiefly in wearing publicly, in token of his Arab
descent, a turban and a long yellow shirt, called El
Dishdasheh.</p>

<p>The Wamrima, or coast-clans, resemble even more
than the half-caste Arabs their congeners the Washenzi.
The pure Omani will not acknowledge them as kinsmen,
declaring the breed to be Aajam, or gentiles. They are
less educated than the higher race, and they are more
debauched, apathetic, dilatory, and inert; their favourite
life is one of sensual indolence. Like the Somal, they
appear to be unfitted by nature for intellectual labour;
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-33">[33]</span>
of the former people there is but one learned man, the
Shaykh Jami of Harar, and the Kazi Muhiyy-el-Din
of Zanzibar is the only literato amongst the Wasawahili.
Study, or indeed any tension of the mind, seems
to make these weak-brained races semi-idiotic. They
cannot answer Yes or No to the simplest question. If,
for example, a man be asked the place of his tribe, he
will point to a distance, though actually living amongst
them; or if questioned concerning some particular of
an event, he will detail everything but what is wanted.
In the earlier days of exploration, I have repeatedly
collected the diwans, and, after a careful investigation
and comparison of statements, have registered the names
and distances of the stages ahead. These men, though
dwelling upon the threshold of the regions which they described,
and being in the habit of traversing them every
year, yet could hardly state a single fact correctly;
sometimes they doubled, at other times they halved,
the distance; they seldom gave the same names, and they
almost always made a hysteron-proteron of the stations.
The reader may gather from this sample some idea of
the difficulties besetting those who would collect information
concerning Africa from the Africans. It would
not have happened had an Arab been consulted. I soon
resolved to doubt for the future all Wasawahili, Wamrima,
Washenzi, and slaves, and I found no reason for
regretting the resolution.</p>

<p>The Wamrima are of darker complexion, and are
more African in appearance, than the coast Arabs. The
popular colour is a dull yellowish bronze. The dress is
a fez, or a Surat-cap; a loin-cloth, which among the
wealthy is generally an Arab check or an Indian print, with
a similar sheet thrown over the shoulders. Men seldom
appear in public without a spear, a sword, or a staff;
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-34">[34]</span>
and priding themselves upon the possession of umbrellas,
they may be seen rolling barrels, or otherwise working
upon the sands, under the luxurious shade. The women
wear a tobe, or long cloth, wrapped tightly round the body,
and extending from beneath the arms to the ankles;
it is a garb ungraceful as was the European “sacque”
of bygone days. It spoils the figure by depressing
instead of supporting the bosom, and it conceals none of
its deficiencies, especially the narrowness of the hips.
The Murungwana, or free-woman, is distinguished from
the slave-girl, when outside the house, by a cloth thrown
over the head. Like the women of the Bedouins and of
the Persian Iliyat, even the matrons of the Mrima go
abroad unmasked. Their favourite necklace is a string
of shark’s teeth. They distend the lobes of the ears to
a prodigious size, and decorate them with a rolled-up
strip of variously-dyed cocoa-leaf, a disk of wood, a plate
of chakazi or raw gum-copal, or, those failing, with a betel-nut
or with a few straws. The left wing of the nose is
also pierced to admit a pin of silver, brass, lead, or even
a bit of manioc-root. The hair, like the body, is copiously
anointed with cocoa-nut or sesamum oil. Some shave
the head wholly or partially across the brow and behind
the ears; others grow their locks to half or full-length,
which rarely exceeds a few inches. It is elaborately
dressed, either in double-rolls rising like bear’s ears on
both sides of the head, or divided into a number of
frizzly curls which expose lines of scalp, and give to the
head the appearance of a melon. They have also a propensity
for savage “accroche-cœurs,” which stand out
from the cheek bones, stiffly twisted like young porkers’
tails. In early youth, when the short, soft, and
crisp hair resembles Astrachan wool, when the muscles
of the face are smoothly rounded, and when the skin has
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-35">[35]</span>
that life and texture, and the countenance has that
vivacity and amiability which belong only to the young,
many of the girls have a pretty piquancy, a little minois
chiffonné, a coquettishness, a natural grace, and a caressing
look, which might become by habit exceedingly prepossessing.
In later life, their charms assume that
peculiar solidity which is said to characterise the beauties
of Mullingar, and as a rule they are shockingly
ugly. The Castilian proverb says that the English
woman should be seen at the window, the French woman
on the promenade, and the Spanish woman everywhere;&mdash;the
African woman should be seen nowhere, or in the
dark. The children mostly appear in the graceful costume
of the Belvidere Apollo; not a few of them have,
to the European eye, that amusing prettiness which we
admire in pug-pups.</p>

<p>The mode of life in the Mrima is simple. Men rise
early and repair to either the shop, the boat, or the
plantation,&mdash;more commonly they waste the morning
in passing from house to house “ku amkía,”&mdash;to salute
neighbours. They ignore “manners”: they enter
abruptly with or without the warning cry of “Hodi!
Hodi!” place their spears in the corner, and without invitation
squat and extend themselves upon the floor till
wearied with conversation they take “French leave.”
Life, to the European so real and earnest, is with
them a continued scene of drumming, dancing, and
drinking, of gossip, squabble, and intrigue. The favourite
inebrients are tembu or cocoa toddy, and mvinyo,
its distillation, pombe or millet-beer, opium, Bhang, and
sometimes foreign stimulants purchased at Zanzibar.
Their food is mostly ugali, the thick porridge of boiled
millet or maize flour, which represents the “staff of life”
in East Africa: they usually feed twice a day, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-36">[36]</span>
morning and at night-fall. They employ the cocoa-nut
extensively: like the Arabs of Zanzibar, they boil their
rice in the thick juice of the rasped albumen kneaded
with water, and they make cakes of the pulp mixed
with the flour of various grains. This immoderate use
of the fruit which, according to the people, is highly refrigerant,
causes, it is said, rheumatic and other diseases.
A respectable man seen eating a bit of raw or undressed
cocoa-nut would be derided by his fellows. They chew
tobacco with lime, like the Arabs, who, under the influence
of Wahhabi tenets, look upon the pipe as impure, and
they rarely smoke it like the Washenzi.</p>

<p>The Wamrima as well as the Wasawahili are distinguished
by two national peculiarities of character.
The first is a cautiousness bordering upon cowardice,
derived from their wild African blood; the second
is an unusual development of cunning and deceitfulness,
which partially results from the grafting of
the semi-civilised Semite upon the Hamite. The
Arabs, who are fond of fanciful etymology, facetiously
derive the race-name “Msawahili” from “Sawwá
hílah,”<a id="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> <i>he played a trick</i>,
and the people boast of it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-37">[37]</span>
saying, “are we not Wasawahili?” that is “artful
dodgers.” Supersubtle and systematic liars, they deceive
when duller men would tell the truth, the lie
direct is no insult, and the offensive word “muongo!”
(liar) enters largely into every dialogue. They lie like
Africans, objectlessly, needlessly, when sure of speedy
detection, when fact would be more profitable than falsehood;
they have not discovered with the civilised knave,
that “honesty is the best policy;” they lie till their fiction
becomes subjectively fact. With them the lie is
no mental exertion, no exercise of ingenuity, no concealment,
nor mere perversion of the truth: it is apparently
a local instinctive peculiarity in the complicated
madness of poor human nature. The most solemn and
religious oaths are with them empty words; they breathe
an atmosphere of falsehood, manœuvre, and contrivance,
wasting about the mere nothings of life&mdash;upon a pound
of grain or a yard of cloth&mdash;ingenuity of iniquity enough
to win and keep a crown. And they are treacherous as
false; with them the salt has no signification, and gratitude
is unknown even by name.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote3"></a><a href="#FNanchor3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
Dr. Krapf, in the Preface to his “Outlines of the Kisuahelí Language,”
deduces the national name from Síwá, ’a hílah, which would mean exactly
the reverse of astute&mdash;“without guile.” He has made other curious linguistic
errors: he translates, for instance, the “Quilimancy” River&mdash;the
ancient name for the Ozi or Dana&mdash;“water from the mountain,” after a
Germanic or Indo-European fashion, whereas, in the Zangian languages, the
compound word would, if admissible, signify “a mountain of water.” It is
curious that the learned and accurate Mr. Cooley, who has charged Dr.
Krapf with “puerile etymologies,” should have fallen into precisely the
same error. In the “Geography of N’yassi,” p. 19, “Mazingia” is rendered
the “road or land along the water,” but Májí Njíá, if the elision of
the possessive affix ya be allowed in prose as in poetry&mdash;Májí Njíá for
Májí ya Njíá&mdash;would mean only the “water of the road.” As a specimen
of Dr. Krapf’s discoveries in philology the following may suffice. In his
vocabulary of the Engutuk Eloikob or Kikuafi dialect, he derives
Olbitir, a <i>pig</i>, from the Arabic El Batrah, a <i>young ass</i>, or from El Basir, a
<i>sharp-seeing dog</i>!</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Though partially Arabised, the Wamrima, as well as
the Wasawahili, retain many habits and customs derived
from the most degraded of the Washenzi savagery.
Like the Wazegura heathen of Eastern Africa, and the
Bangala of the Kasanji (Cassange) Valley, in the West,
the uncle sells his nephews and nieces by an indefeasible
vested right, with which even the parents cannot interfere.
The voice of society even justifies this abomination.
“What!” exclaim the people, “is a man to want when
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-38">[38]</span>
his brothers and sisters have children?” He is thus encouraged
in doing, on the slightest pretext, that of which
the heathen rarely approve, except to save themselves
from starvation. At the same time the Wamrima, holding
the unchastity of woman as a tenet of belief, consider
the sister’s son&mdash;the “surer side”&mdash;the heir, in
preference to the son. They have many superstitions,
and before all undertakings they consult a pagan Mganga
or medicine-man. If the K’hunguru or crow caws from
the house-top, a guest is coming; if a certain black bird
cries “chee! chee!” in front of a caravan, the porters
will turn back, saying that there is blood on the road,
and they will remain four or five days till the “chika!
chika!” of the partridge beats the “General.” An even
number of wayfarers met in early morning is a good
omen, but an odd number, or the bark of the Mbweha&mdash;the
fox&mdash;before the march, portends misfortune. Strong
minds of course take advantage of these and a thousand
other follies of belief, and when there is not, as in civilised
countries, a counteracting influence of scepticism,
the mental organisation of the people becomes a mass of
superstitious absurdities.</p>

<p>The chief industry of the Mrima, namely the plundering
of caravans, has already been alluded to; it will
here be described with somewhat more of detail. The
industrious and commercial nations near Kilwa and the
southern regions delay but a few days on the coast; the
Wanyamwezi, on the line now to be described, will linger
there from three to six months, enjoying the dear delights
of comparative civilisation. Many old campaigners
have so far overcome their barbarous horror of water
travelling, which has been increased by tales of shipwreck
and drowning, as to take boat and carry their ivory to
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-39">[39]</span>
the more profitable market in this land of Zanzibar,
where the Wanyamwezi occupy their own quarter.
Arrived within two marches of the coast-town, the head
of the caravan calls a halt till the presents promised by
an escort of touters have arrived and have been approved
of. He then delays as long as possible, to live gratis upon
those with whom he proposes to deal. After a time, the
caravan enters in stately procession, a preliminary to the
usual routine of commercial operations. Having settled
the exorbitant claims of the village headmen and the
charges of the Zanzibar Government, which are usually
levied in duplicate by the local authorities, the barbarian
has recourse to the Indian Banyan. Bargains are usually
concluded at night: to a civilised man the work
would be an impossible trial of patience. A lot of two
hundred tusks is rarely sold under four months. Each
article is laid upon the ground, and the purchaser begins
by placing handsome cloths, technically called “pillows,”
under the point and bamboo of the tusk, and by
covering its whole length with a third; these form the
first perquisites of the seller. After a few days, during
which rice and ghee, sugar and sweetmeats, must be
freely supplied, commences the chaffering for the price.
The Banyan becomes excited at the ridiculous demand
of his client, screams like a woman, pushes him out of
doors, and receives a return of similar treatment with
interest. He takes advantage of his knowledge that the
African in making a bargain is never satisfied with the
first offer, however liberal; he begins with a quarter of
the worth, then he raises it to one-half, and when the
barbarian still hesitates he throws in some flashy article
which turns the scale. Any attempt at a tariff would be
contemptuously rejected by both parties. The African
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-40">[40]</span>
delights in bargaining, and the Indian having brighter
wits relies upon them for a profit, which the establishment
of fair prices would curtail. It were in vain to
attempt any alteration in this style of doing “business;”
however despicable it may appear in the London market,
it is a time-honoured institution in East Africa.</p>

<p class="noindent">It was a gallant sight to see the Baloch, as with trailed
matchlocks, and in bravery of shield, sword, and dagger,
they hurried in Indian file out of the Kaole cantonments,
following their blood-red flag and their high-featured,
snowy-bearded chief, the “Shaib Mohammed,”&mdash;old
Mohammed. The band, “like worms,” as they
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-42">[42]</span>
expressed its numbers, which amounted to nearly a
hundred, about one-third of the venerable Jemadar’s
command, was marching forth to bid us farewell, in
token of respect, at Mgude or Kuingani, “the cocoa-plantation
near the sea.” It is a little settlement, distant
an hour and a half’s walk from Kaole: hither my
companion had preceded me, and hence we were to
make our second departure. Accompanied by Said bin
Salim, Valentine my Goanese servant, three Baloch,
and two slaves, I followed in the wake of the main
body, bringing up the rear of the baggage on three
Unyamwezi asses bought that morning at the custom-house.
The animals had been laden with difficulty:
their kicking and plunging, rearing and pawing, had
prevented the nice adjustment of their packs, and the
wretched pads, which want of time had compelled me
to take, instead of panels or pack-saddles, loosely girthed
with rotten coir rope, could not support a heap of
luggage weighing at least 200 lbs. per load. On the road
they rushed against one another; they bolted, they
shied, and they threw their impediments with such
persistence, that my servant could not help exclaiming,
“Unká nám gadha”&mdash;“Their name <i>is</i> jackass.” At last,
as the sun neared the salt sea, one of these half-wild
brutes suddenly sank, girth-deep, in a patch of boggy
mire, and the three Baloch, my companions, at once
ran away, leaving us to extricate it as best we could.
This little event had a peculiar significancy to one
about to command a party composed principally of
asses and Baloch.</p>

<p>The excitement of finding myself on new ground,
and the peculiarities of the scenery, somewhat diverted
melancholy forebodings. Issuing from the little palisade
of Kaole, the path winds in a south-westerly direction
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-43">[43]</span>
over a sandy soil, thick with thorns and bush, which in
places project across the way. Thence ascending a
wave of ground where cocoas and the wild arrow-root
flourish, it looks down upon park land like that described
by travellers in Kaffraria, a fair expanse of
sand veiled with humus, here and there growing rice,
with mangoes and other tall trees, regularly disposed
as if by the hand of man. Finally, after crossing a
muddy grass-grown swamp, and a sandy bottom full
of water when rain has been heavy, the path, passing
through luxuriant cultivation, enters Kuingani. Such
is the “nakl,” or preparatory-stage of Arab travellers,
an invariable first departure, where porters who find
their load too heavy, or travellers who suspect that
they are too light, can return to Kaole and re-form.</p>

<p>The little settlement of Kuingani is composed of a
few bee-hive huts, and a Bandani or wall-less thatched
roof&mdash;the village palaver-house&mdash;clustering orderless
round a cleared central space. Outside, cocoas, old and
dwarfed, mangoes almost wild, the papaw, the cotton
shrub, the perfumed Rayhan or Basil, and a sage-like
herb, the sugarcane, and the Hibiscus called by the
Goanese “Rosel,” vary the fields of rice, holcus, and
“Turiyan,” or the Cajanus Indicus. The vegetation is,
in fact, that of the Malabar coast; the habitations are
peculiarly African.</p>

<p>The 28th of June was a halt at Kuingani, where I was
visited by Ramji and two brother Bhattias, Govindji
and Kesulji. The former was equipped, as least becomes
the Banyan man, with sword, dudgeon, and
assegai. But Ramji was a heaven-made soldier; he
had taken an active part in the military operations
directed by His Highness the late Sayyid Said against
the people of the mainland, and about thirteen years
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-44">[44]</span>
ago he defended Kaole against a host of Wazaramo,
numbering, it is said, 3,000 men, when, lacking balls,
he had loaded his honeycombed cannon and his rusty
matchlocks with pointed sticks. The Europeans of
Zanzibar called him “Rush,”&mdash;the murderer. His
fellow-countrymen declared him to be a “sharp practiser,”
who had made a reputation by spending other
people’s money, and I personally had proofs which did
not allow me to doubt his “savoir faire.”</p>

<p>The nights at Kuingani were not pleasant. The air
was stifling, the mosquitoes buzzed without intermission,
and I had neglected to lay in “essence of pennyroyal”
against certain other plagues. On the second
evening, seeing by the hang-dog look of my Jemadar
that he was travailing in mind, I sent for a Mganga
or medicine-man, and having previously promised him
a Surat skull-cap for a good haul of prophecy, I collected
the Baloch to listen. The Mganga, a dark old man, of
superior rank, as the cloth round his head and his many
bead necklaces showed, presently reappeared with a
mat-bag containing the implements of his craft. After
taking his seat opposite to me he demanded his fee&mdash;here,
as elsewhere, to use the words with which Kleon
excited the bile of Tiresias,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="verse indent00">“Το μαντικον γαρ παν φιλαργυρον γενος;”<br /></span>
</div><!--stanza-->

</div><!--poetry-->
</div><!--poetry-container-->

<p class="noindent">&mdash;without which prediction would have been impossible.
When gratified he produced a little gourd
snuff-box and indulged himself with a solemn and
dignified pinch. He then drew forth a larger gourd
which contained the great medicine, upon which no
eye profane might gaze: the vessel, repeatedly shaken,
gave out a vulgar sound as if filled with pebbles and bits
of metal. Presently, placing the implement upon the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-45">[45]</span>
ground, Thaumaturges extracted from the mat-bag two
thick goat’s horns connected by a snake-skin, which
was decorated with bunches of curiously-shaped iron
bells; he held one in the left hand, and with the right
he caused the point of the other to perform sundry
gyrations, now directing it towards me, then towards
himself, then at the awe-struck bystanders, waving his
head, muttering, whispering, swaying his body to and
fro, and at times violently rattling the bells. When fully
primed with the spirit of prophecy, and connected by
ekstasis with the ghosts of the dead, he spake out pretty
much in the style of his brotherhood all the world
over. The journey was to be prosperous. There would
be much talking, but little killing.&mdash;Said bin Salim, in
chuckling state, confessed that he had heard the same
from a Mganga consulted at Zanzibar.&mdash;Before navigating
the sea of Ujiji a sheep or a parti-coloured hen
should be killed and thrown into the lake.&mdash;Successful
voyage.&mdash;Plenty of ivory and slaves.&mdash;Happy return
to wife and family.</p>

<p>This good example of giving valuable advice was
not lost upon Mr. Rush Ramji. He insisted upon the
necessary precautions of making a strong kraal and of
posting sentinels every night; of wearing a kerchief
round the head after dark, and of avoiding the dangerous
air of dawn; of not eating strange food, and of
digging fresh wells, as the Wazaramo bewitch water for
travellers; of tethering the asses, of mending their ropes,
and of giving them three lbs. of grain per diem. Like
the medical directions given to the French troops proceeding
to China, the counsel was excellent, but impracticable.</p>

<p>The evening concluded with a nautch. Yusuf, a
Baloch, produced a saringi&mdash;the Asiatic viol&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-46">[46]</span>
collected all the scamps of the camp with a loud scraping.
Hulluk, the buffoon, acted dancing-girl to perfection.
After the normal pantomime, somewhat broadly expressed,
he did a little work in his own character;
standing on his head with a peculiar tremulousness
from the hips upwards, dislocating his person in a sitting
position, imitating the cry of a dog, cat, ape,
camel, and slave-girl, and finally reproducing me
with peculiar impudence before my face. I gave him
a dollar, when, true to his strain, he at once begged
another.</p>

<p>All accounts and receipts being finally duly settled
with the Hindus, the last batch of three donkeys having
arrived, and the baggage having been laden with great
difficulty, I shook hands with old Mohammed and the
other dignitaries, and mounting my ass, gave orders for
immediate departure from Kuingani. This was not
effected without difficulty: every one and everything,
guide and escort, asses and slaves, seemed to join in raising
up fresh obstacles. Four <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> sped before we turned
out of the little settlement. Among other unpleasant
occurrences, Rahmat, a Baloch knave, who had formed
one of my escort to Fuga, levelled his long barrel, with
loud “Mimí ná pigá” (I am shooting him), when his
company was objected to. His Jemadar, Yaruk, seized
the old shooting-iron, which was probably unloaded,
and Rahmat, with sotto-voce snarls and growls, slunk
back to his kennel. A turbaned Negroid, who appeared
on the path, was asked to point out the way,
and, on his refusal, my bull-headed slave Mabruki
struck him on the face, when, to the consternation
of all parties, he declared himself a Diwan. The blow,
according to the Jemadar, would infallibly lead to
bloodshed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-47">[47]</span></p>

<p>After a second short march of one hour and a half,
we pitched tents and obtained lodgings in Bomani,
“the Stockade,” a frontier village, but within the jurisdiction
of Bagamoyo. On this road, which ascended the
old sea-beach, patches of open forest and of high rank
grass divided cultivated clearings, where huts and
hamlets appeared, and where modest young maidens
beckoned us as we passed. The vegetation is here
partly African, partly Indian. The Mbuyu,&mdash;the baobab,
Adansonia digitata, monkey-bread, or calabash, the Mowana
of the southern and the Kuka of the northern
regions,&mdash;is of more markedly bulbous form than on the
coast, where the trunk is columnar; its heavy extremities,
depressed by the wind, give it the shape of a
lumpy umbrella shading the other wild growths. There
appear to be two varieties of this tree, similar in bole
but differing in foliage and in general appearance. The
normal Mbuyu has a long leaf, and the drooping outline
of the mass is convex; the rarer, observed only upon the
Usagara Mountains, has a small leaf, in colour like the
wild indigo, and the arms striking upwards assume the
appearance of a bowl. The lower bottoms, where the soil
is rich, grow the Mgude, also called Mparamusi (Taxus
elongatus, the Geel hout or Yellow-wood of the Cape?) a
perfect specimen of arboreal beauty. A tall tapering shaft,
without knot or break, straight and clean as a main-mast
forty or forty-five feet in height, and painted with a
tender greenish-yellow, is crowned with parachute-shaped
masses of vivid emerald foliage, whilst sometimes two and
even three pillars spring from the same root. The Mvumo,&mdash;a
distorted toddy tree, or Hyphæna allied to the Daum
palm of Egypt and Arabia,&mdash;has a trunk rough with
the drooping remnants of withered fronds, above which
it divides itself into branches resembling a system of Y’s.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-48">[48]</span>
Its oval fruit is of a yellowish red, and when full-sized it
is as large as a child’s head; it is eaten even unripe by
the people, and is said to be the favourite food of the
elephant. Pulpless, hard, and stringy, it has, when
thoroughly mature, a slight taste of gingerbread, hence
it is also called the Gingerbread-tree. The Ukhindu or
brab, of whose fronds mats and the grass kilts worn by
many of the tribes are made, flourishes throughout the
country, proving that the date-tree might be naturalised.
The Nyara or Chamærops humilis, the dwarf fan-palm
or palmetto of Southern Europe, abounds in this
maritime region. The other growths are the Mtogwe
and the Mbungo-bungo, varieties of the Nux vomica;
the finest are those growing in the vicinity of water.
The fruit contains within its hard rind, which, when
ripe, is orange-coloured, large pips, covered with a
yellow pulp of a grateful agro-dolce flavour, with a
suspicion of the mango. The people eat them with
impunity; the nuts, which contain the poisonous principle,
being too hard to be digested. The Mtunguja
(the Punneeria coagulans of Dr. Stocks), a solanaceous
plant called by the Indians Jangli bengan, or the wild
egg-plant, by the South Africans Toluane, and by the
Baloch Panír, or cheese, from the effect of the juice
in curdling milk, is here, as in Somaliland, a spontaneous
growth throughout the country. The same
may be said of the castor plant, which, in these regions,
is of two kinds. The Mbono (Jatropha curcas?) is the
Gumpal of Western India, a coarse variety, with a
large seed; its fetid oil, when burnt, fouls the lamp;
yet, in Africa, it is used by all classes as an unguent.
The Mbarika, or Palma Christi, the Irindi of India, is
employed in medicine. The natives extract the oil by
toasting and pounding the bean, adding a little hot
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-49">[49]</span>
water and skimming off what appears upon the surface.
The Arabs, more sensibly, prefer it “cold-drawn.”
These plants, allowed to grow unpruned,
often attain the height of eighteen to twenty feet.</p>

<p>The 30th June was another forced halt, when I tasted
all the bitterness that can fall to the lot of those who
explore regions unvisited by their own colour. The
air of Bomani is stagnant, the sun fiery, and clouds of
mosquitoes make the nights miserable. Despite these
disadvantages, it is a favourite halting-place for up-caravans,
who defer to the last the evil days of long
travel and short rations. Though impressed with the
belief, that the true principle of exploration in these
lands is to push on as rapidly and to return as leisurely
as possible, I could not persuade the Baloch to move.
In Asia, two departures usually suffice; in Africa there
must be three,&mdash;the little start, the great start, and the
start κατ’ εξοχην. Some clamoured for tobacco&mdash;I gave
up my cavendish; others for guitar-strings&mdash;they were
silenced with beads; and all, born donkey-drivers,
complained loudly of the hardship and the indignity of
having to load and lead an ass. The guide, an influential
Mzaramo, promised by the Banyans Ladha and Ramji,
declined, after receiving twenty dollars, to accompany the
Expedition, and from his conduct the Baloch drew the
worst of presages. Much ill-will was shown by them
towards the European members of the Expedition.
“Kafir end, márá bandirá na khenen” (they are infidels
and must not carry our flag)&mdash;it was inscribed with the
usual Moslem formula&mdash;was spoken audibly enough in
their debased Mekrani to reach my ears: a faithful
promise to make a target of the first man who might
care to repeat the words, stopped that manner of
nuisance. Again the most childish reports flew about
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-50">[50]</span>
the camp, making these jet-bearded and fierce-eyed hen-hearts
faint with fears. Boxes had been prepared by
the barbarians for myself, and gates had been built
across the paths to arrest my party. P’hazi Mazungera,
M. Maizan’s murderer, had collected a host that numbered
thousands, and the Wazaramo were preparing a
levée <i>en masse</i>. To no purpose I quoted the Arab’s proverb&mdash;“the
son of fifty dieth not at thirty”; all <i>would</i>
be heroic victims marching to gory graves. Such reports
did real damage: the principal danger was the tremulous
alacrity with which the escort prepared upon each trivial
occasion for battle and murder, and sudden death.
At one place a squabble amongst the villagers kept the
Baloch squatting on their hams with lighted matches
from dusk till dawn. At another, a stray Fisi or Cynhyæna
entering the camp by night, caused a confusion
which only the deadliest onslaught could have justified.
A slave hired on the road, hearing these horrors, fled in
dismay; this, the first of desertions, was by no means
the last. The reader may realise the prevalence and
the extent of this African traveller’s bane by the fact
that during my journey to Ujiji there was not a soul in
the caravan, from Said bin Salim the Arab, to the veriest
pauper, that did not desert or attempt to desert.</p>

<p>Here, at the first mention of slaves, I must explain to
the reader why we were accompanied by them, and
how the guide and escort contrived to purchase them.
All the serving-men in Zanzibar Island and on the coast
of E. Africa are serviles; the Kisawahili does not contain
even a word to express a hired domestic. For the evil
of slave-service there was no remedy: I therefore paid
them their wages and treated them as if they were freemen.
I had no power to prevent Said bin Salim, the
Baloch escort, and the “sons of Ramji,” purchasing
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-51">[51]</span>
whomever they pleased; all objections on my part were
overruled by, “we are allowed by our law to do so,”
and by declaring that they had the permission of the
consul. I was fain to content myself with seeing that
their slaves were well fed and not injured, and indeed I
had little trouble in so doing, as no man was foolish
enough to spoil his own property. I never neglected
to inform the wild people that Englishmen were pledged
to the suppression of slavery, and I invariably refused
all slaves offered as return presents.</p>

<p>The departure from Bomani was effected on the 1st
of July with some trouble; it was like driving a herd of
wild cattle. At length, by ejecting skulkers from their
huts, by dint of promises and threats, of gentleness and
violence, of soft words and hard words, occasionally
backed by a smart application of the “Bakur”&mdash;the local
“cat”&mdash;by sitting in the sun, in fact by incessant worry
and fidget from 6 <span class="smcapall">A. M.</span> to 3 <span class="smcapall">P. M.</span>, the sluggish and unwieldy
body acquired some momentum. I had issued
a few marching orders for the better protection of the
baggage: two Baloch were told off for each donkey, one to
lead, the other to drive; in case of attack, those near the
head of the file, hearing the signal, three shots, were to
leave their animals and to hurry to the front, where my
companion marched, whilst the remainder rallied round
my flag in the rear: thus there would have been an
attacking party and a reserve, between which the asses
would have been safe. The only result of these fine
manœuvres was, that after a two-mile tramp through an
umbrageous forest in which caravans often lose the way,
and then down an easy descent across fertile fields, into
a broken valley, whose further side was thick with luxuriant
grass, tall shrubs, and majestic trees, a confused
straggling line,&mdash;a mere mob of soldiers, slaves, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-52">[52]</span>
asses,&mdash;arrived at the little village of Mkwaju la
Mvuani,&mdash;the “Tamarind in the rains.”</p>

<p>The settlement is composed as usual of a few hovels
and a palaver-house, with a fine lime-tree, the place of
lounging and gossip, grain-husking, and mat-weaving, in
the open centre. Provisions and rough muddy water
being here plentiful, travellers often make a final halt
to polish their weapons, and to prepare their minds for
the Wazaramo. It is the last station under the jurisdiction
of Bagamoyo; from Changahera, the crafty old
Diwan, I obtained the services of his nephew Muinyi
Wazírá, who received seventeen dollars as an inducement
to travel in the interior, and was at once constituted linguist
and general assistant to Said bin Salim. The day
passed as usual, a snake was killed, and a gun-shot heard
in the distance supplied conversation for some hours.
The “sons of Ramji” carefully lost half a dozen of
the axes, bill-hooks, and dibbles, with which they had
been supplied, fearing lest they might be called upon to
build the Síwá or Bomá, the loose thorn-fence with which
the halting-place ought to be surrounded before the
night, and 7 <span class="smcapall">P. M.</span> had passed before I could persuade the
Baloch to catch, tether, and count the asses. One of
the escort, Ismail, was attacked with dysentery and
required to be mounted, although we were obliged by
the want of carriage to wend our way on foot. During
the last night, Said bin Salim had taken charge of three
Wanguru porters, who, freshly trapped by Said el Hazrami,
had been chained <i>pro tempore</i> to prevent desertion.
The Arab boasted that he was a bad sleeper, but bad
sleepers are worse watchers, because when they do sleep
they sleep in earnest. The men were placed for the
night in Said’s tent, surrounded by his five slaves, yet they
stole his gun, and carrying off an axe and sundry bill-hooks,
disappeared in the jungle. The watchful Said, after
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-53">[53]</span>
receiving many congratulations on his good fortune&mdash;fugitive
slaves sometimes draw their knives across the
master’s throat or insert the points into his eyes&mdash;sent
off his own attendants to recover the fugitives. In the
jungle, however, search was of scant avail: the Wanguru
feared that if caught by the Baloch, they would lose their
ears; three days would enable them to reach their own
country; and their only risk was that if trapped by the
Washenzi before their irons&mdash;a valuable capture to the
captors&mdash;could be removed, they might again be sold to
some travelling trader. As the day wore on, Said’s face
assumed a deplorable expression: his slaves had not appeared,
and though several of them were muwallid or
born in his father’s house, and one was after a fashion
his brother-in-law, he sorely dreaded that they also had
deserted. He was proportionably delighted when in the
dead of the night, entering Mkwaju la Mvuani, they
reported ill-success; and though I could little afford the
loss, I was glad to get rid of this chained and surly gang.</p>

<p>On the next day we began loading for the third and
final departure, before dawn, and at 7.30 <span class="smcapall">A. M.</span> were
on the dew-dripping way. Beyond the settlement a
patch of jungle led to cultivated grounds belonging
to the villagers, whose scattered and unfenced abodes
were partially concealed by dense clumps of trees.
The road then sweeping parallel with the river plain,
which runs from N.W. to S.E., crossed several swamps,
black muddy bottoms covered with tall thick rushes
and pea-green paddy, and the heavily laden asses sunk
knee-deep into the soft soil. Red copalliferous sand
clothed the higher levels. On the wayside appeared
for the first time the Khambi or substantial kraals,
which evidence unsafe travelling and the unwillingness
of caravans to bivouac in the villages. In this region
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-54">[54]</span>
they assumed the form of round huts and long sheds or
boothies of straw or grass supported by a framework
of rough sticks firmly planted in the ground and lashed
together with bark-strips. The whole was surrounded
with a deep circle of thorns which&mdash;the entrance or
entrances being carefully closed at nightfall, not to reopen
until dawn&mdash;formed a complete defence against
bare feet and naked legs. About half-way a junction
of the Mbuamaji road was reached, and the path became
somewhat broader and less rough. Passing on the
right, a hilly district, called Dunda or “the Hill,” the
road fell from the ancient sea-beach into the alluvial
valley of the Kinganí River; presently rising again, it
entered the settlement of Nzasa, a name interpreted
“level ground.”</p>

<p>Nzasa is the first district of independent Uzaramo.
My men proceeded to occupy the Bandani, in the centre
of the hamlet, when Said bin Salim, discovering with the
sharp eye of fear a large drum, planted in readiness for
the war-signal or the dance-signal, hurried about till
he had turned all hands out of the village into a
clump of trees hard by, a propitious place for surprise
and ambuscade. Here I was visited by three P’hazi or
headmen, Kizaya, Tumba Ihere or the “poison gourd,”
and Kombe la Simba or the “lion’s hide.” They came
to ascertain whether I was bound on peaceful errand or&mdash;as
the number of our guns suggested&mdash;I was marching
to revenge the murder of my “brother” Muzungu.
Assured of our unwarlike intentions, they told me that
I must halt on the morrow and send forward a message
to the next chief. As this plan invariably loses three
days,&mdash;the first being a <i>dies non</i>, the second being expended
in dispensing exoteric information to all the
lieges squatting in solemn conclave, whilst on the third
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-55">[55]</span>
the real message is privily whispered into the chieftain’s
ear,&mdash;I replied through Said that I could not be bound
by their rules, but was ready to pay for their infraction.
During the debate upon this fascinating proposal for
breaking the law, Yusuf, one of the most turbulent
of the Baloch, drew his sword upon an old woman
because she refused to give up a basket of grain. She
rushed, with the face of a black Medusa, into the
assembly, and provoked not very peaceable remarks
concerning the peaceful nature of our intentions. When
the excitement was allayed, the principal P’hazi began to
ask what had brought the white man into their country,
and in a breath to predict the loss of their gains and
commerce, their land and liberty. “I am old,” pathetically
quoth the P’hazi, “and my beard is grey, yet I
have never beheld such a calamity as this!” “These
men,” replied Said, “neither buy nor sell; they do not
inquire into price, nor do they covet profit. Moreover,”
he pursued, “what have ye to lose? The
Arabs take your best, the Wasawahili your second best,
and your trifling tribute is reduced to a yoke of
bullocks, a few clothes, or half a dozen hoes.” An
extravagant present&mdash;at that time ignorance of the
country compelled me to intrust such matters to the
honesty of Said bin Salim&mdash;opened the headmen’s
hearts: they privily termed me Murungwana Sana, a
real free-man, the African equivalent for the English
“gentleman,” and they detached Kizaya to accompany
me as far as the western half of the Kingani Valley.
At 4 <span class="smcapall">P. M.</span> a loud drumming collected the women,
who began to perform a dance of ceremony with
peculiar vigour. A line of small, plump, chestnut-coloured
beings, with wild beady eyes, and a thatch of
clay-plastered hair, dressed in their loin-cloths, with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-56">[56]</span>
profusion of white disks, bead necklaces, a little square
bib of beads called a t’hando, partially concealing the
upper bosom, with short coils of thick brass wire wound
so tightly round the wrists, the arms above the elbows,
and the fat ankles, that they seemed to have grown into
the flesh, and,&mdash;hideous perversion of taste!&mdash;with
ample bosoms tightly corded down, advanced and retired
in a convulsion of wriggle and contortion, whose fit
expression was a long discordant howl, which seemed to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="verse indent00">“Embowel with outrageous noise the air.”<br /></span>
</div><!--stanza-->

</div><!--poetry-->
</div><!--poetry-container-->

<p class="noindent">I threw them a few strings of green beads, which for
a moment interrupted the dance. One of these falling
to the ground, I was stooping to pick it up when Said
whispered hurriedly in my ear, “Bend not; they will
say ‘he will not bend even to take up beads!’”</p>

<p>In the evening I walked down to the bed of the
Kingani river, which bisects a plain all green with
cultivation,&mdash;rice and holcus, sweet potato and tobacco,&mdash;and
pleasantly studded with huts and hamlets. The
width of the stream, which here runs over a broad
bed of sand, is about fifty yards; it is nowhere fordable,
as the ferry-boat belonging to each village proves,
and thus far it is navigable, though rendered dangerous
by the crocodiles and the hippopotami that house in
its waters. The colour is tawny verging upon red,
and the taste is soft and sweet, as if fed by rain. The
Kingani, like all streams in this part of the continent,
is full of fish, especially a dark-green and scaleless
variety (a Silurus?) called Kambari, and other local
names. This great “miller’s thumb” has fleshy cirri,
appears to be omnivorous, and tastes like animal mud.
The night was rendered uncomfortable to the Baloch
by the sound of distant drums, which suggested fighting
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-57">[57]</span>
as well as feasting, and by the uproar of the wild men,
who, when reconnoitred by the scouts, were found to
be shouting away the hippopotami.</p>

<p>In the hurry and the confusion of loading on the
next morning one ass was left behind, and the packs
were so badly placed that the fatigue of marching was
almost doubled by their repeated falls. Whilst descending
the well-wooded river terrace, my portion of the
escort descried an imaginary white flag crossing the
grassy valley below. This is the sign of a Diwan’s expedition
or commando: it is unwisely allowed by the
Arabs, whose proper colours are a plain blood-red.
After marching a few miles over undulating ground,
open and parklike, and crossing rough and miry beds,
the path disclosed a view verging upon the pretty. By
the way side was planted the peculiarly African Mzimu
or Fetiss hut, a penthouse about a foot high, containing,
as votive offerings, ears of holcus or pombe-beer in a
broken gourd. There, too, the graves of the heathen
met the eye. In all other parts of East Africa a mouldering
skull, a scattered skeleton, or a few calcined bones,
the remains of wizards and witches dragged to the
stake, are the only visible signs of man’s mortality. The
Wazaramo tombs, especially in the cases of chiefs, imitate
those of the Wamrima. They are parallelograms,
seven feet by four, formed by a regular dwarf paling
that encloses a space cleared of grass, and planted with
two uprights to denote the position of head and feet. In
one of the long walls there is an apology for a door.
The corpse of the heathen is not made to front any
especial direction; moreover the centre of the oblong
has the hideous addition of a log carved by the unartistic
African into a face and a bust singularly resembling
those of a legless baboon, whilst a white rag tied
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-58">[58]</span>
turbanwise round the head serves for the inscription
“this is a man.” The Baloch took notice of such idolatrous
tendency by spitting and by pronouncing certain
national anathemas, which literally translated might
sound unpleasant in Europeans’ ears. The abomination
of iconism is avoided in the graves of Moslem travellers:
they are usually cleared ovals, with outlines of rough
stone and a strew of smooth pebbles, according to the
custom of the Wasawahili. Several stumps of wood
planted in the earth show that the corpse faces Mecca,
and, as amongst the Jinga of Western Africa, the fragments
of a china bowl or cup lying upon the ground
are sacred to the memory of the departed. In Zanzibar
Island, also, saucers, plates, and similar articles are mortared
into the tombstones.</p>

<p>The number of these graves made the blackness of my
companions pale. They were hurrying forward with
sundry “la haul!” and with boding shakes of the head,
when suddenly an uproar in the van made them all
prepare for action. They did it characteristically by
beginning with begging for ranjak&mdash;priming powder.
Said bin Salim, much excited, sent forward his messmate
Muinyi Wazira to ascertain the cause of the
excitement. One Mviraru, the petty lord of a neighbouring
village, had barred the road with about a dozen
men, demanding “dash,” and insisting that Kizaya had
no right to lead on the party without halting to give
him the news. My companion, who was attended only
by “Bombay,” his gun-carrier, and a few Baloch, remarked
to the interferers that he had been franked
through the country by paying at Nzasa. To this they
obstinately objected. The Baloch began to light their
matches and to use hard words. A fight appeared
imminent. Presently, however, when the Wazaramo
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-59">[59]</span>
saw my flag rounding the hill-shoulder with a fresh
party, whose numbers were exaggerated by distance,
they gave way; and finally when Muinyi Wazira opened
upon them the invincible artillery of his tongue, they
fell back and stood off the road to gaze. The linguist
returned to the rear in great glee, blowing his finger
tips, as if they had been attached to a matchlock, and
otherwise deriding the overboiling valour of the Beloch,
who, not suspecting his purport, indulged in the wildest
outbreak of boasting, offering at once to take the whole
country and to convert me into its sultan. Towards
the end of the march we crossed a shallow, salt, bitter
rivulet, flowing cold and clear towards the Kingani
River. On the grassy plain below noble game&mdash;zebra
and koodoo&mdash;began to appear; whilst guinea-fowl and
partridge, quail, green-pigeon, and the cuculine bird,
called in India the Malabar-pheasant, became numerous.
A track of rich red copalliferous soil, wholly without
stone, and supporting black mould, miry during the
rains, and caked and cracked by the potent suns of
the hot season, led us to Kiranga-Ranga, the first dangerous
station in Uzaramo. It is the name of a hilly
district, with many little villages embosomed in trees,
overlooking the low cultivated bottoms where caravans
encamp in the vicinity of the wells.</p>

<p>Before establishing themselves in the kraal at Kiranga-Ranga,
the two rival parties of Baloch,&mdash;the Prince’s
permanent escort and the temporary guard sent by Ladha
Damha from Kaole&mdash;being in a chronic state of irritability,
naturally quarrelled. With the noise of choughs
gathering to roost they vented their bile, till thirteen men
belonging to a certain Jemadar Mohammed suddenly
started up, and without a word of explanation set out on
their way home. According to Said bin Salim, the temporary
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-60">[60]</span>
guard had determined not to proceed beyond
Kiranga-Ranga, and this desertion was intended as a
preliminary to others by which the party would have lost
two-thirds of its strength. I at once summoned the
Jemadars, and wrote in their presence a letter reporting
the conduct of their men to the dreaded Balyuz, the
consul, who was supposed to be still anchored off Kaole.
Seeing the bastinado in prospect, the Jemadar Yaruk
shouldered his sabre, slung his shield over his arm, set
out in pursuit of the fugitives, and soon succeeded in
bringing them back. He was a good specimen of the true
Baloch mountaineer&mdash;a tall, gaunt, and large-boned
figure, with dark complexion deeply pitted by small-pox,
hard, high, and sun-burnt features of exceeding harshness;
an armoury in epitome was stuck in his belt, and
his hand seemed never to rest but upon a weapon.</p>

<p>The 4th of July was a halt at Kiranga-Ranga. Two
asses had been lost, the back-sinews of a third had been
strained, and all the others had been so wearied by their
inordinate burdens, to which on the last march the meat
of a koodoo, equal in weight to a young bullock, had
been superadded, that a rest was deemed indispensable.
I took the opportunity of wandering over and of prospecting
the country. The scene was one of admirable
fertility; rice, maize, and manioc grew in the rankest
and richest crops, and the uncultivated lands bore the
Corindah bush (Carissa Carandas), the salsaparilla vine,
the small whitish-green mulberry (the Morus alba of
India), and the crimson flowers of the Rosel. In the
lower levels near the river rose the giants of the forest.
The Mparamusi shot up its tall head, whose bunchy
tresses rustled in the breeze when all below was still. The
stately Msufi, a Bombax or silk-cotton tree, showed as
many as four or five trunks, each two to three feet in
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-61">[61]</span>
diameter, rising from the same roots; the long tapering
branches stood out stiffly at right angles from the bole;
and the leaves, instead of forming masses of foliage, were
sparsely scattered in small dense growth. The Msukulio,
unknown to the people of Zanzibar, was a pile of dark verdure,
which dwarfed the finest oaks and elms of an English
park. No traces of game appeared in the likeliest
of places; perhaps it preferred lurking in the tall gross
grass, which was not yet in a fit state to burn.</p>

<p>At Kiranga-Ranga the weather began to be unpropitious.
The Mcho’o, the heavy showers which fall between
the Masika or vernal, and the Vuli or autumnal
rains, set in with regularity, and accompanied us during
the transit of the maritime plain. I therefore refused to
halt more than one day, although the P’hazi or chiefs of
the Wazaramo showed, by sending presents of goats and
grain, great civility&mdash;a civility purchased, however,
by Said bin Salim at the price of giving to each
man whatever he demanded; even women were never
allowed to leave the camp unpropitiated. I was not
permitted in this part to enter the villages, although the
Wazaramo do not usually exclude strangers who venture
upon their dangerous hospitality. Girls are appointed
to attend upon them, and in case of sickness or
accident happening to any one in the settlement, they
are severely interrogated concerning the morality of the
guest, and an unfavourable account of it leads to extortion
and violence. The Wazaramo, like the Wagogo,
and unlike the other East African tribes, are jealous of
their women; still “damages” will act, as they have
acted in other lands, as salve to wounded honour and
broken heart.</p>

<p>On the 5th of July we set out betimes, and traversing
the fields around Kiranga-Ranga, struck through a
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-62">[62]</span>
dense jungle, here rising above, there bending into the
river valley, to some stagnant pools which supply the
district with water. The station, reached in 3<sup>hrs</sup> 30′,
was called Tumba Ihere, after the headman, who
accompanied us. Here we saw cocos emerging from a
fetid vegetation, and for the last time the Mwembe or
mango, a richly foliaged but stunted tree which never
attains the magnificent dimensions observed at Zanzibar.
Several down-caravans were halted at Tumba Ihere;
the slaves brought from the interior were tied together
by their necks, and one obstinate deserter was so lashed
to a forked pole with the bifurcation under his chin,
that when once on the ground he could not rise without
assistance. These wretches scarcely appeared to like
the treatment; they were not, however, in bad condition.
The Wanyamwezi porters bathed in the pools and looked
at us without fear or shame. Our daily squabble did
not fail to occur. Riza, a Baloch, drew his dagger on one
of Said bin Salim’s “children,” and the child pointed his
Tower-musket at the Baloch; a furious hubbub arose;
the master, with his face livid and drawn like a cholera
patient’s, screamed shrilly as a woman, and the weapons
returned to their proper places bloodless as those
wielded by Bardolph, Nym, and ancient Pistol. My
companion began to suffer from the damp heat and the
reeking miasma; he felt that a fever was coming
on, and the fatigue of marching under these circumstances
prevented our mustering the party. The consequence
was, that an ass laden with rice disappeared,&mdash;it
had probably been led out of the road and unburdened
by the Baloch;&mdash;whilst axes, cords, and tethers could
nowhere be found when wanted.</p>

<p>On the next morning we left Tumba Ihere, and
tramped over a red land through alternate strips of rich
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-63">[63]</span>
cultivation and tangled jungle, which presently opened
out into a forest where the light-barked Msandarusi, or
copal-tree, attains its fullest dimensions. This is one
of the richest “diggins,” and the roadsides are everywhere
pitted with pockets two or three feet deep by one
in diameter. Rain fell in huge drops, and the heaviness of
the ground caused frequent accidents to the asses’ loads.
About noon we entered the fine grain-fields that gird
the settlements of Muhogwe, one of the most dreaded
in dreaded Uzaramo. In our case, however, the only
peril was the levée <i>en masse</i> of the fair sex in the villages,
to stare, laugh, and wonder at the white men. “What
should you think of these whites as husbands?” asked
Muinyi Wazira of the crowd. “With such things on
their legs?&mdash;Sivyo!&mdash;not by any means!”&mdash;was the
unanimous reply, accompanied with peals of merriment.</p>

<p>Beyond Muhogwe all was jungle and forest, tall trees
rising from red copalliferous sand, and shading bright
flowers, and blossoming shrubs. After crossing a low
mud overgrown with rush and tiger-grass, and a
watercourse dotted with black stagnant pools, we ascended
rising well-forested ground, and lastly debouched
upon the kraals of Muhonyera.</p>

<p>The district of Muhonyera occupies the edge of the
plateau forming the southern terrace of the Kingani
River; and the elevated sea-beach is marked out by
lines of quartsoze pebbles running along the northern
slope of the hill upon which we encamped. Water is
found in seven or eight reedy holes in the valley below;
it acquires from decomposed vegetation an unnaturally
sweet and slimy taste. This part of the country, being
little inhabited by reason of its malarious climate, abounds
in wild animals. The guides speak of lions, and the cry
of the Fisi or Cynhyæna was frequently heard at night,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-64">[64]</span>
threatening destruction to the asses. The Fisi, the
Wuraba of the Somal, and the Wilde Honde of the
Cape, is the wolf of Africa, common throughout the
country, where it acts as scavenger. Though a large
and powerful variety, it seldom assaults man, except
when sleeping, and then it snatches a mouthful from
the face, causing a ghastlier disfigurement even than
the scalping of the bear. Three asses belonging to the
Expedition were destroyed by this beast; in all cases
they were attacked by night with a loud wrangling
shriek, and the piece of flesh was raggedly torn from
the hind quarter; after affording a live rump-steak,
they could not be driven like Bruce’s far-famed bullock.
These, however, were the animals brought from Zanzibar;
that of Unyamwezi, if not tied up, defends itself
successfully against its cowardly assailant with
teeth and heels, even as the zebra, worthy of Homeric
simile, has, it is said, kept the lion at bay. The woods
about Muhonyera contain large and small grey monkeys
with black faces; clinging to the trees they gaze for a
time at the passing caravan imperturbably, till curiosity
being satisfied, they slip down and bound away with
long plunging leaps, like a greyhound at play. The
view from the hill-side was suggestive. The dark green
plain of sombre monotony, with its overhanging strata
of mist-bank and dew-cloud, appeared in all the worst
colours of the Oude Tirhai and the Guzerat jungles.
At that season, when the moisture of the rainy monsoon
was like poison distilled by the frequent bursts of fiery
sunshine, it was a valley of death for unacclimatised
travellers. Far to the west, however, rose Kidunda,
“the hillock,” a dwarf cone breaking the blurred blue
line of jungle, and somewhat northward of it towered
a cloud-capped azure wall, the mountain-crags of
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-65">[65]</span>
Duthumi, upon which the eye, long weary of low levels,
rested with a sensation of satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was found necessary to halt a day at Muhonyera:
according to some authorities no provisions were procurable
for a week; others declared that there were villages
on the road, but were uncertain whether rations could
be purchased. Said bin Salim sent Ambari, a favourite
slave, back to buy grain at Muhogwe, whence he had hurried
us on in fear of the Wazaramo; and the youth, after
wasting a day, returned on the evening of the 2nd July
with about sixty lbs.,&mdash;a poor supply for eighty-eight
hungry bodies. This proceeding naturally affronted the
Baloch, who desired for themselves the perquisites proceeding
from the purchases. Two of their number,
Yusuf and Salih Mohammed, came to swear officially
on the part of their men that there was not an ounce of
grain in camp. Appearing credulous, I paid them a
visit about half an hour afterwards; all their shuffling
and sitting upon the bags could not conceal a store of
about 100 lbs. of fine white rice, whose quality,&mdash;the
Baloch had been rationed at Kaole with an inferior kind,&mdash;showed
whence it came.</p>

<p>After repairing the “boma,” or fenced kraal,&mdash;it had
been burnt down, as often happens, by the last caravan of
Wanyamwezi,&mdash;I left my companion, who was prostrate
with fever, and went out, gun in hand, to inspect the
country, and to procure meat, that necessary having
fallen short. The good P’hazi, Tumba Ihere, accompanied
me, and after return he received an ample
present for his services, and departed. The Baloch employed
themselves in cleaning their rusty matchlock-barrels
with a bit of kopra,&mdash;dried cocoa-nut meat,&mdash;in
weaving for themselves sandals, like the spartelle of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-66">[66]</span>
Pyrenees, with green palmetto-leaves; in preparing
calabash fibre for fatilah or gun-matches, and in twisting
cords for the asses. The best material is supplied by an
aloetic plant, the Hig or Haskul of Somaliland, here
called by the Arabs Bag, and by the natives Mukonge.
The Mananazi, or pine-apple, grows wild as far as three
marches from the coast, but its fibrous qualities are
unknown to the people. Ismail, the invalid Baloch, was
the worse for remedies; and two other men gave signs
of breaking down.</p>

<p>During the first week, creeping along at a slug’s
pace, we heard the booming of the Artémise’s evening
gun, an assurance that refuge was at hand. Presently
these reports ceased. Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, seized
with mortal sickness, had left Kaole suddenly, and he
died on board the Artémise on the 5th July, shortly
after his return to Zanzibar. The first letters announcing
the sad event were lost: with characteristic African
futility the porter despatched with the parcel from the
island, finding that the Expedition had passed on to the
mountains of Usagara, left his charge with a village
headman, and returned to whence he came. Easterns
still hold that</p>

<p class="noindent">The report, spread by a travelling trader, was discussed
throughout the camp, but I was kept in ignorance of it
till Khudabakhsh, a Baloch, who had probably been
deputed by his brethren to ascertain what effect the
decease of the consul would have upon me, “hardened
his heart,” and took upon himself the task of communicating
the evil intelligence. I was uncertain what to
believe. Said bin Salim declared, when consulted, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-67">[67]</span>
he fully trusted in the truth of the report, but his
reasons were somewhat too Arabo-African to convince
me. He had found three pieces of scarlet broadcloth
damaged by rats,&mdash;an omen of death; and the colour
pointed out the nationality of the departed.</p>

<p>The consul’s death might have proved fatal to the
Expedition, had its departure been delayed for a week.
The court of Zanzibar had required the stimulus of a
strong official letter from Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, before
it would consent, as requested by the Foreign
Office, “to procure a favourable reception on the coast,
and to ensure the protection of the chiefs of the country”
for the travellers. The Hindus, headed by Ladha
Damha, showed from first to last extreme unwillingness
to open up the rich regions of copal and ivory to
European eyes: they had been deceived by my silence
during the rainy season at Zanzibar into a belief that the
coast-fever had cooled my ardour for further adventure;
and their surprise at finding the contrary to be the
case was not of a pleasant nature. The home-sick
Baloch would have given their ears to return, they
would have turned back even when arrived within a
few marches from the Lake. Said bin Salim took the
first opportunity of suggesting the advisability of his
returning to Zanzibar for the purpose of completing
carriage. I positively refused him leave; it was a mere
pretext to ascertain whether His Highness the Sayyid
Majid had or had not, in consequence of our changed
position, altered his views.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton’s death, however, was
mourned for other than merely selfish considerations.
His hospitality and kindness had indeed formed a well-omened
contrast with my unauspicious reception at
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-68">[68]</span>
Aden in 1855, before my departure to explore the
Eastern Horn of Africa, when the coldness of some, and
the active jealousy of other political authorities, thwarted
all my projects, and led to the tragic disaster at
Berberah.<a id="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton had received two
strangers like sons, rather than like passing visitors.
During the intervals between the painful attacks of a
deadly disease, he had exerted himself to the utmost in
forwarding my views; in fact, he made my cause his
own. Though aware of his danger, he had refused to
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-69">[69]</span>
quit, until compelled by approaching dissolution, the
post which he considered his duty to hold. He was a
loss to his country, an excellent linguist, a ripe oriental
scholar, and a valuable public servant of the old
Anglo-Indian school; he was a man whose influence
over Easterns, based upon their respect for his honour
and honesty, his gallantry and determination, knew no
bounds; and at heart a “sad good Christian,”&mdash;the
Heavens be his bed!</p>

Capt. R. L. Playfair, Madras Artillery and First Assistant Pol.
Resident, Aden, in a selection from the records of the Bombay Government,
(No. 49, new series, Bombay, printed for Government, at the Education
Society Press, Byculla, 1859,) curiously misnamed “A History of Arabia
Felix or Yemen,” transports himself, in a “supplementary chapter,” to
East Africa, and thus records his impressions of what happened in the
“Somali <span class="nowrap">Country:”&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1855.&mdash;“During the afternoon of the same day (the 18th of April), three
men visited the camp, <i>palpably as spies</i>, and as such, <i>the officers of the
Expedition were warned against them by their native attendants</i>. Heedless of
this warning, they retired to rest at night in the fullest confidence of
security, and without having taken any extra, <i>or even ordinary means</i>, to
guard against surprise.”</p>

<p>The italics are my own: they designate mistatements unpardonable in an
individual whose official position enabled him to ascertain and to record the
truth. The three men were represented to me as spies, who came to ascertain
whether I was preparing to take the country for the Chief Shermarkay,
then hostile to their tribe, not as spies to spy out the weakness of my party.
I received no warning of personal danger. The “ordinary measures,” that
is to say, the posting of two sentinels in front and rear of the camp during
the night were taken, and I cannot blame myself because they ran away.</p>

<p>I will not stop to inquire what must be the value of Capt. Playfair’s 193
pages touching the history of Yemen, when in five lines there are three
distinct and wilful deviations from fact.</p>

<p>I am well aware that after my departure from Aden, in 1855, an inquiry
was instituted during my absence, and without my knowledge, into the facts
of the disaster which occurred at Berberah. The “privileged communication”
was, I believe, in due course, privily forwarded to the Bombay Government,
and the only rebuke which this shuffling proceeding received was from
a gentleman holding a high and honourable position, who could not reconcile
himself to seeing a man’s character stabbed in the back.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>On the 8th of July we fell into what our Arab
called Wady el Maut and Dar el Jua&mdash;the Valley
of Death and the Home of Hunger&mdash;the malarious
river-plain of the Kingani River. My companion was
compelled by sickness to ride, and thus the asses, now
back-sore and weak with fatigue, suffered an addition of
weight, and a “son of Ramji” who was upon the point
of deserting openly required to be brought back at the
muzzle of the barrel. The path descending into a dense
thicket of spear grass, bush, and thorny trees based on
sand, with a few open and scattered plantations of holcus,
presently passed on the left Dunda Nguru, or “Seer-fish-hill,”
so called because a man laden with such provision
had there been murdered by the Wazaramo. After
2<sup>hrs</sup>. 45′ a ragged camping-kraal was found on the
tree-lined bank of a half-dry Fiumara, a tributary of
the neighbouring Kingani: the water was bad, and a
mortal smell of decay was emitted by the dark dank
ground. It was a wild day. From the black brumal
clouds driven before furious blasts pattered rain-drops
like musket-bullets, splashing the already saturated
ground. The tall stiff trees groaned and bent before
the gusts; the birds screamed as they were driven from
their perching places; the asses stood with heads depressed,
ears hung down, and shrinking tails turned
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-70">[70]</span>
towards the weather, and even the beasts of the wild
seemed to have taken refuge in their dens. Provisions
being unprocurable at “Sagesera,” the party did what
men on such occasions usually do&mdash;they ate double
quantities. I had ordered a fair distribution of the
rice that remained, consequently they cooked all day.
Yusuf, a Jemadar of inferior rank, whose friends characterised
him as “sweet of tongue but bitter at heart,”
vainly came to beg, on plea of hunger, dismissal for
himself and his party; and another Baloch, Wali, reported
as uselessly that a sore foot would prevent him
advancing.</p>

<p>Despite our increasing weakness, we marched seven
hours on the 9th of July, over a plain wild but prodigiously
fertile, and varied by patches of field, jungle
and swamp, along the right bank of the Kingani river,
to another ragged old kraal, situated near a bend in
the bed. This day showed the ghost of an adventure.
At the “Makutaniro,” or junction of the Mbuamaji
trunk-road with the other lines branching from various
minor sea-ports, my companion, who was leisurely proceeding
with the advance guard, found his passage
barred by about fifty Wazaramo standing across the
path in a single line that extended to the travellers’
right, whilst a reserve party squatted on the left
of the road. Their chief stepping to the front and
quietly removing the load from the foremost porter’s
head, signalled the strangers to halt. Prodigious excitement
of the Baloch, whose loud “Hai, hui!” and
nervous anxiety contrasted badly with the perfect <i>sang
froid</i> of the barbarians. Presently, Muinyi Wazira
coming up, addressed to the headman a few words,
promising cloth and beads, when this African modification
of the “pike” was opened, and the guard moved
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-71">[71]</span>
forward as before. As I passed, the Wazaramo stood
under a tree to gaze. I could not but admire the
athletic and statuesque figures of the young warriors
and their martial attitude, grasping in one hand their
full-sized bows, and in the other sheaths of grinded
arrows, whose black barbs and necks showed a fresh
layer of poison.</p>

<p>At Tunda, “the fruit,” so called from its principal
want, after a night passed amidst the rank vegetation,
and within the malarious influence of the river, I arose
weak and depressed, with aching head, burning eyes,
and throbbing extremities. The new life, the alternations
of damp heat and wet cold, the useless fatigue of
walking, the sorry labour of waiting and re-loading the
asses, the exposure to sun and dew, and last, but not least,
of morbific influences, the wear and tear of mind at the
prospect of imminent failure, all were beginning to tell
heavily upon me. My companion had shaken off his
preliminary symptoms, but Said bin Salim, attacked
during the rainy gusty night by a severe Mkunguru or
seasoning-fever, begged hard for a halt at Tunda&mdash;only
for a day&mdash;only for half a day&mdash;only for an
hour. Even this was refused. I feared that Tunda
might prove fatal to us. Said bin Salim was mounted
upon an ass, which compelled us to a weary trudge of
two hours. The animals were laden with difficulty;
they had begun to show a predilection for lying down.
The footpath, crossing a deep nullah, spanned a pestilential
expanse of spear-grass, and a cane, called from
its appearance Gugu-mbua, or the wild sugar plant,
with huge calabashes and natural clearings in the
jungle, where large game appeared. After a short march
I saw the red flag of the vanguard stationary, and
turning a sharp corner found the caravan halted in
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-72">[72]</span>
a little village, called from its headman Ba̓ńá Dirungá.
This was premature. I had ordered Muinyi Wazira
to advance on that morning to Dege la Mhora, the “large
jungle-bird,” the hamlet where M. Maizan’s blood was
shed. Said and Wazira had proposed that we should
pass it ere the dawn of the next day broke; the advice
was rejected, it was too dangerous a place to show fear.
The two diplomatists then bethought themselves of
another manœuvre, and led me to Ba̓ńá Dirungá, calling
it Dege la Mhora.</p>

<p>We halted for a day at the little hamlet, embosomed
in dense grass and thicket. On our appearance the
villagers fled into the bush, their country’s strength;
but before nightfall they took heart of grace and
returned. The headman appeared to regard us with
fear, he could not comprehend why we carried so much
powder and ball. When reassured he offered to precede
us, and to inform the chief of the “large jungle-bird”
that our intentions had been misrepresented,&mdash;a
proposal which seemed to do much moral good to Said,
the Jemadar, and Wazira.</p>

<p>On the eleventh day after leaving Kaole I was obliged
to mount by a weakness which scarcely allowed me
to stand. After about half an hour, through a comparatively
open country, we passed on the left a well-palisaded
village, belonging formerly to P’hazi Mazungera,
and now occupied by his son Hembe, or the
“wild buffalo’s horn.” Reports of our warlike intentions
had caused Hembe to “clear decks for action;” the
women had been sent from the village, and some score
of tall youths, archers and spearmen, admirably appointed,
lined the hedges, prepared, at the levelling of
the first matchlock, to let loose a flight of poisoned
arrows, which would certainly have dispersed the whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-73">[73]</span>
party. A halt was called by the trembling Said, who
at such conjunctures would cling like a woman to my
companion or to me. During the few minutes’ delay the
“sons of Ramji,” who were as pale as blacks could be,
allowed their asses to bump off half a dozen loads. Presently
Hembe, accompanied by a small guard, came forward,
and after a few words with Wazira and Said, the
donkey from which I had not dismounted was hurried
forward by the Baloch. Hembe followed us with a
stronger escort to Madege Madogo, the next station.
Illness served me as an excuse for not receiving him:
he obtained, however, from Said a letter to the headmen
of the coast, bespeaking their good offices for certain of
his slaves sent down to buy gunpowder.</p>

<p>An account of the melancholy event which cut short
at Dege la Mhora the career of the first European that
ever penetrated beyond this portion of the coast may
here be inserted.</p>

<p>M. Maizan, an <i>enseigne de vaisseau</i>, and a pupil of
the Polytechnic School, after a cruise in the seas off
Eastern Africa, conceived, about the end of 1843, the
project of exploring the lakes of the interior, and in
1844 his plans were approved of by his government.
Arrived at Bourbon, he was provided with a passage to
Zanzibar, in company with M. Broquant, the Consul de
France, newly appointed after the French Commercial
Treaty of the 21st Nov. 1844, on board the corvette Le
Berceau, Capitaine, afterwards Vice-Admiral, Romain
Desfossés, commanding. At the age of twenty-six M.
Maizan had amply qualified himself by study for travel,
and he was well provided with outfit and instruments.
His “kit,” however, was of a nature calculated to excite
savage cupidity, as was proved by the fact that his
murderer converted the gilt knob of a tent-pole into a
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-74">[74]</span>
neck ornament, and tearing out the works of a gold
chronometer, made of it a tobacco-pouch. He has been
charged with imprudence in carrying too much luggage&mdash;a
<i>batterie de déjeuner</i>, a <i>batterie de dîner</i>, and similar
superfluities. But he had acted rightly, when bound
upon a journey through countries where outfit cannot
be renewed, in providing himself with all the materials
for comfort. On such explorations a veteran traveller
would always attempt to carry with him as much, not
as little as possible,&mdash;of course prepared to abandon all
things, and to reduce himself, whenever the necessity
might occur, to the “<i>simple besace du pélerin</i>.” It is
easy to throw away a superfluity, and the best preparation
for severe “roughing it,” is to enjoy ease and
comfort whilst attainable.</p>

<p>But M. Maizan fell upon evil times at Zanzibar. Dark
innuendos concerning French ambition&mdash;that nation
being even suspected of a desire to establish itself in
force at Lamu, Pangani, and other places on the coast
of East Africa&mdash;filled Hindu and Hindi with fear for
their profits. These men influenced the inhabitants of
the island and the sea-coast, who probably procured the
co-operation of their wild brethren in the interior.
For the purpose of learning the Kisawahili, M. Maizan
delayed nearly eight months at Zanzibar, and, seeing a
French vessel entering the harbour, he left the place
precipitately, fearing a recall. Vainly also M. Broquant
had warned him against his principal confidant,
a noted swindler, and Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton had
cautioned him to no purpose that his glittering instruments
and his numerous boxes, all of which would be
supposed to contain dollars, were dangerous. He
visited the coast thrice before finally landing, thus
giving the Wasawahili time and opportunity to mature
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-75">[75]</span>
their plans. He lowered himself in the eyes of the
Arabs by “making brotherhood” with a native of Unyamwezi.
Finally, fearing Arab apathy and dilatoriness,
he hastened into the country without waiting for the
strong armed escort promised to him by His Highness
the late Sayyid Said.</p>

<p>These were grave errors; but they were nothing in comparison
with that of trusting himself unarmed, after the
fatal habit of Europeans, and without followers, into the
hands of an African chief. How often has British India
had to deplore deaths “that would have dimmed a victory,”
caused by recklessness of danger or by the false
shame which prevents men in high position from wearing
weapons where they may be at any moment
required, lest the safe mediocrities around them should
deride such excess of cautiousness!</p>

<p>After the rains of 1845 M. Maizan landed at Bagamoyo,
a little settlement opposite the island of Zanzibar.
There leaving the forty musketeers, his private guard,
he pressed on, contrary to the advice of his Mnyamwezi
brother, escorted only by Frédérique, a Madagascar or
Comoro man, and by a few followers, to visit P’hazi Mazungera,
the chief of the Wákámbá, a subtribe of the
Wazaramo, at his village of Dege la Mhora. He was
received with a treacherous cordiality, of which he appears
to have been completely the dupe. After some
days of the most friendly intercourse, during which the
villain’s plans were being matured, Mazungera, suddenly
sending for his guest, reproached him as he entered
the hut with giving away goods to other chiefs.
Presently working himself into a rage, the African exclaimed,
“Thou shalt die at this moment!” At the
signal a crowd of savages rushed in, bearing two long
poles. Frédérique was saved by the P’hazi’s wife: he
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-76">[76]</span>
cried to his master to run and touch her, in which case
he would have been under her protection; but the
traveller had probably lost presence of mind, and the
woman was removed. The unfortunate man’s arms
were then tightly bound to a pole lashed crosswise upon
another, to which his legs and head were secured by a
rope tied across the brow. In this state he was carried
out of the village to a calabash-tree, pointed out to me,
about fifty yards on the opposite side of the road. The
inhuman Mazungera first severed all his articulations,
whilst the war-song and the drum sounded notes of
triumph. Finding the sime, or double-edged knife,
somewhat blunt, he stopped, when in the act of cutting
his victim’s throat, to whet the edge, and, having finished
the bloody deed, he concluded with wrenching the head
from the body.</p>

<p>Thus perished an amiable, talented, and highly educated
man, whose only fault was rashness&mdash;too often the
word for enterprise when Fortune withholds her smile.
The savage Mazungera was disappointed in his guest’s
death. The object of the torture was to discover, as the
Mganga had advised, the place of his treasures, whereas
the wretched man only groaned and implored forgiveness
of his sins, and called upon the names of those
friends whose advice he had neglected. The P’hazi then
attempted to decoy from Bagamoyo the forty musketeers
left with the outfit, but in this he failed. He then proceeded
to make capital of his foul deed. When Snay bin
Amir, a Maskat merchant,&mdash;of whom I shall have much
to say,&mdash;appeared with a large caravan at Dege la Mhora,
Mazungera demanded a new tribute for free passage;
and, as a threat, he displayed the knife with which he
had committed the murder. But Snay proved himself
a man not to be trifled with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-77">[77]</span></p>

<p>Frédérique returned to Zanzibar shortly after the
murder, and was examined by M. Broquant. An infamous
plot would probably have come to light had he
not fled from the fort where he was confined. Frédérique
disappeared mysteriously. He is said now to be living
at Marungu, on the Tanganyika Lake, under the Moslem
name of Muhammádí. His flight served for a pretext
to mischievous men that the prince was implicated in
the murder: they also spread a notoriously false report
that Mazungera, an independent chief, was a vassal of
the suzerain of Zanzibar.</p>

<p>In 1846 the brig-of-war Le Ducoüedic, of the
naval division of Bourbon, M. Guillain, Capitaine de
Vaisseau, commanding, was charged, amongst other commercial
and political interests, with insisting upon severe
measures to punish the murderers. In vain His Highness
Sayyid Said protested that Mazungera was beyond his
reach; the fact of the robber-chief having been seen at
Mbuamaji on the coast after the murder was deemed conclusive
evidence to the contrary. At length the Sayyid
despatched up-country three or four hundred musketeers,
mercenaries, and slaves, under command of Juma Mfumbi,
the late, and Bori, the present, Diwan of Saadani.
The little troop marched some distance into the country,
when they were suddenly confronted by the Wazaramo,
commanded by Hembe, the son of Mazungera, who,
after skirmishing for a couple of days, fled wounded by
a matchlock-ball. The chief result of the expedition
was the capture of a luckless clansman who had beaten
the war-drum during the murder. He was at once
transferred to Zanzibar, and passed off by these transparent
African diplomatists as P’hazi Mazungera. For
nearly two years he was chained in front of the French
Consulate; after that time he was placed in the fort
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-78">[78]</span>
heavily ironed to a gun under a cadjan shed, where he
could hardly stand or lie down. The unhappy wretch
died about a year ago, and Zanzibar lost one of its lions.</p>

<p>After the slaughter of M. Maizan the direct route
through Dege la Mhora was long closed, it is said, and
is still believed, by a “ghul,” a dragon or huge serpent,
who, of course, was supposed to be the demon-ghost of
the murdered man. The reader will rejoice to hear that
the miscreant Mazungera, who has evaded human, has
not escaped divine punishment. The miserable old man
is haunted by the P’hepo or spirit of the guest so foully
slain: the torments which he has brought upon himself
have driven him into a kind of exile; and his tribe, as
has been mentioned, has steadily declined from its former
position with even a greater decline in prospect. The
jealous national honour displayed by the French Government
on the occasion of M. Maizan’s murder has
begun to bear fruit.</p>

<p>Its sensitiveness contrasts well with our proceedings
on similar occasions. Rahmat, the murderer of Captain
Milne, still wanders free over the hills in sight of Aden.
By punishing the treacherous slaughter of a servant of
Government, the price of provisions at the coal-hole of
the East would have been raised. Au Ali, the murderer
of Lieut. Stroyan, is still at large in the neighbourhood
of Berberah, when a few dollars would have
brought in his head. The burlesque of a blockade,&mdash;Capt.
Playfair, in a work previously characterised, has
officially mistermed it, to the astonishment of Aden, “a
rigid blockade,” a “severe punishment,” and so forth,&mdash;was
considered sufficient to chastise the Somal of Berberah
for their cowardly onslaught on strangers and guests;
and though the people offered an equivalent for the
public and private property destroyed by them, the spirit
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-79">[79]</span>
of Centralisation, by an exercise of its peculiar attributes,
omniscience and omnipresence, decided that the
indemnity, which in such cases is customary throughout
the East, must not be accepted, because&mdash;forsooth!&mdash;it
was not deserved by the officers. This is a new plan, a
system lately adopted by the nation once called “la plus
orgueilleuse et la plus perilleuse”&mdash;to win and preserve
respect in lands where prestige is its principal power.
The Arabs of Yemen have already learned from it to
characterise their invaders as Sahib Hilah,&mdash;a tricky,
peddling manner of folk. They&mdash;wiser men than
we&mdash;will not take upon themselves the pains and
penalties of subject-hood, without its sole counterweight,
the protection of their rulers, in cases where
protection is required.</p>

<p>At Madege Madogo, the “little birds,” so called in
contradistinction to its western and neighbouring
district, Madege Makuba, the “great birds,” we
pitched tent under a large sycamore; and the Baloch
passed a night of alarms, fancying in every sound the
approach of a leopard, a hippopotamus, or a crocodile.
On the 13th July, we set out after dawn, and traversing
forest, jungle, and bush, chequered with mud and
morass, hard by the bending and densely-wooded line of
the Kingani River, reached in three hours’ march an unwholesome
camping-ground, called from a conspicuous
landmark Kidunda, the “little hill.” Here the scenery
is effective. The swift, yellow stream, about fifty yards
broad, sweeps under tall, stiff earth-works, ever green
with tangled vegetation and noble trees. The conical
huts of the cultivators are disposed in scattered patches
to guard their luxuriant crops, whilst on the northern
bank the woody hillock, and on the southern rising
ground, apparently the ancient river-terrace, affect the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-80">[80]</span>
sight agreeably after the evergreen monotony of the
river-plain. A petty chief, Mvirama, accompanied by
a small party of armed men, posted himself near the
cantonment, demanding rice, which was refused with
asperity. At this frontier station the Wazaramo, mixed
up with the tribes of Udoe, K’hutu, and Usagara, are no
longer dreaded.</p>

<p>From Kidunda, the route led over sandy ground,
with lines and scatters of water-worn pebbles, descended
the precipitous inclines of sandstone, broken
into steps of slabs and flags, and crossed the Manyora,
a rough and rocky Fiumara, abounding in blocks of
snowy quartz, grey and pink syenites, erratic boulders
of the hornblende used as whetstones, and strata of a
rude sandstone conglomerate. Thence it spanned grass,
bush, and forest, close to the Kingani, and finally
leaving the stream on the right hand, it traversed
sandy soil, and, ascending a wave of ground, abutted
upon the Mgeta or rivulet, a large perennial influent,
which, rising in the mountains of Duthumi, drains the
head of the River-valley.</p>

<p>This lower portion of the Mgeta’s bed was unfordable
after the heavy rains: other caravans, however,
had made a rude bridge of trees, felled on each side,
lashed with creepers, and jammed together by the force
of the current. The men perched upon the trunks and
boughs, tossed or handed to one another the loads and
packages, whilst the asses, pushed by force of arm down
the banks, were driven with sticks and stones across the
stream. Suddenly a louder cry than usual arose from
the mob; my double-barrelled elephant-gun found a
grave below the cold and swirling waters. The Goanese
Gaetano had the courage to plunge in; the depth was
about twelve feet; the sole was of roots and loose sand,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-81">[81]</span>
and the stream ran with considerable force. I bade farewell
to that gun;&mdash;by the bye it was the second accident
of the kind that had occurred to it;&mdash;the country people
cannot dive, and no one ventures to affront the <i>genius
loci</i>, the mamba or crocodile. I found consolation in
the thought that the Expedition had passed without
accident through the most dangerous part of the
journey. In 18 days, from the 27th of June, to the
14th of July, I had accomplished, despite sickness
and all manner of difficulties, a march of 118 indirect
statute miles, and had entered K’hutu, the safe rendezvous
of foreign merchants.</p>

<p>Resuming our march on the 15th July, we entered
the “Doab,”<a id="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> on the western bank of the Mgeta,
where a thick and tangled jungle, with luxuriant and
putrescent vegetation, is backed by low, grassy grounds,
frequently inundated. Presently, however, the dense
thicket opened out into a fine park country, peculiarly
rich in game, where the calabash and the giant trees of
the seaboard gave way to mimosas, gums, and stunted
thorns. Large gnus, whom the porters regard with a
wholesome awe, declaring that they are capable of
charging a caravan, pranced about, pawing the
ground, and shaking their formidable manes; hartebeest
and other antelopes clustered together on the
plain, or travelled in herds to slake their thirst at the
river. The homely cry of the partridge resounded from
the brake, and the guinea-fowls looked like large bluebells
upon the trees. Small land-crabs took refuge in
the pits and holes, which made the path a cause of
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-82">[82]</span>
frequent accidents; whilst ants of various kinds,
crossing the road in close columns, attacked man and
beast ferociously, causing the caravan to break into a
halting, trotting hobble, ludicrous to behold. Whilst
crossing a sandy Fiumara, Abdullah, a Baloch, lodged
by accident four ounces of lead, the contents of my
second elephant-gun, in the head of an ass. After a
march of six hours we entered Kiruru, a small, ragged,
and muddy village of Wak’hutu, deep in a plantation of
holcus, whose tall, stiff canes nearly swept me from the
saddle. The weather was a succession of raw mist,
rain in torrents, and fiery sunbursts; the land appeared
rotten, and the jungle smelt of death. At Kiruru I
found a cottage, and enjoyed for the first time an atmosphere
of sweet warm smoke. My companion
remained in the reeking, miry tent, where he partially
laid the foundation of the fever which threatened his
life in the mountains of Usagara.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote5"></a><a href="#FNanchor5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
This useful word, which means the land embraced by the bifurcation of
two streams, has no English equivalent. “Doab,” “Dhun” (Dhoon),
“Nullah,” and “Ghaut,” might be naturalised with advantage in our mother
tongue.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Despite the danger of hyænas, leopards, and crocodiles
to an ass-caravan, we were delayed by the torrents of
rain and the depth of the mud for two days at Kiruru.
According to the people, the district derives its name
“palm leaves,” from a thirsty traveller, who, not
knowing that water was near, chewed the leaves of the
hyphæna-palm till he died. One of the Baloch proposed
a “Hammam,”&mdash;a primitive form of the “lamp-bath,”
practised in most parts of Central Asia,&mdash;as a
cure for fever: he placed me upon one of the dwarf
stools used by the people, and under the many abas or
hair-cloaks with which I was invested he introduced a
bit of pottery containing live coal and a little frankincense.
At Kiruru I engaged six porters to assist our
jaded animals as far as the next station. The headman
was civil, but the people sold their grain with difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-83">[83]</span></p>

<p>On the 18th July we resumed our march over a tract
which caused sinking of the heart in men who expected
a long journey under similar circumstances. Near
Kiruru the thick grass and the humid vegetation, dripping
till midday with dew, rendered the black earth
greasy and slippery. The road became worse as we
advanced over deep thick mire interlaced with tree-roots
through a dense jungle and forest, chiefly of the distorted
hyphæna-palm, in places varied by the Mparamusi and
the gigantic Msukulío, over barrens of low mimosa, and
dreary savannahs cut by steep nullahs. In three places
we crossed bogs from 100 yards to a mile in length, and
admitting a man up to the knee; the porters plunged
through them like laden animals, and I was obliged to
be held upon the ass. This “Yegea Mud,” caused by
want of water-shed after rain, is sometimes neck-deep; it
never dries except when the moisture has been evaporated
by sun and wind during the middle of the Kaskazi
or N. E. monsoon. The only redeeming feature in the
view was a foreground of lovely hill, the highlands of
Dut’humi, plum-coloured in the distance and at times
gilt by a sudden outburst of sunshine. Towards the
end of the march, I forged ahead of the caravan, and
passing through numerous villages, surrounded by
holcus-fields, arrived at a settlement tenanted by Sayf
bin Salim, an Arab merchant, who afterwards proved to
be a notorious “mauvais sujet.” A Harisi from Birkah
in Oman, he was a tall thin-featured venerable-looking
man, whose old age had been hurried on by his constancy
to pombe-beer. A long residence in Unyamwezi had
enabled him to incur the hostility of his fellow-merchants,
especially one Salim bin Said el Sawwafi, who, with
other Arabs, persuaded Mpagamo, an African chief, to
seize upon Sayf, and after tying him up in full view of
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-84">[84]</span>
the plundering and burning of his store-house, to drive
him out of the country. Retreating to Dut’humi, he
had again collected a small stock in trade, especially of
slaves, whom he chained and treated so severely that all
men predicted for him an evil end. “Msopora,” as he
was waggishly nicknamed by the Wanyamwezi, instantly
began to backbite Said bin Salim, whom he pronounced
utterly unfit to manage our affairs; I silenced him by
falling asleep upon a cartel placed under the cool eaves
of a hut. Presently staggered in my companion almost
too ill to speak; over-fatigue had prostrated his strength.
By slow degrees, and hardly able to walk, appeared the
Arab, the Baloch, the slaves and the asses, each and
every having been bogged in turn. On this occasion
Wazira had acted guide, and used to “bog-trotting,”
he had preferred the short cut to the cleaner road that
rounds the swamps.</p>

<p>At Dut’humi we were detained nearly a week; the
malaria had brought on attacks of marsh fever, which
in my case lasted about 20 days; the paroxysms were
mild compared with the Indian or the Sindhian type,
yet, favoured by the atonic state of the constitution, they
thoroughly prostrated me. I had during the fever-fit,
and often for hours afterwards, a queer conviction of
divided identity, never ceasing to be two persons that
generally thwarted and opposed each other; the sleepless
nights brought with them horrid visions, animals of
grisliest form, hag-like women and men with heads protruding
from their breasts. My companion suffered
even more severely, he had a fainting-fit which strongly
resembled a sun-stroke, and which seemed permanently
to affect his brain. Said bin Salim was the convalescent
of the party; the two Goanese yielded themselves
wholly to maladies, brought on mainly by hard
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-85">[85]</span>
eating, and had they not been forced to rise, they would
probably never have risen again. Our sufferings were
increased by other causes than climate. The riding
asses having been given up for loads, we were compelled,
when premonitory symptoms suggested rest, to walk,
sometimes for many miles in a single heat, through sun
and rain, through mud and miasmatic putridities.
Even ass-riding caused over-fatigue. It by no means
deserves in these lands the reputation of an anile exercise,
as it does in Europe. Maître Aliboron in Africa
is stubborn, vicious and guilty of the four mortal sins
of the equine race, he shies and stumbles, he rears and
runs away: my companion has been thrown as often
as twice in two hours. The animals are addicted to
fidgetting, plunging and pirouetting when mounted,
they hog and buck till they burst their frail girths, they
seem to prefer holes and hollows, they rush about pig-like
when high winds blow, and they bolt under tree-shade
when the sun shines hot. They must be led, or, ever
preferring the worst ground, they disdain to follow the
path, and when difficulties arise the slave will surely drop
the halter, and get out of harm’s way. If a pace exceeding
two miles an hour be required, a second man must
follow and flog each of these perfect slugs during the
whole march. The roundness of their flanks, the shortness
of their backs, and their want of shoulder, combine
to make the meagre Arab packsaddle unsafe for anything
but a baboon or a boy, whilst the straightness and
the rigidity of their goat-like pasterns render the pace a
wearisome, tripping hobble. We had, it is true, Zanzibari
riding-asses, but the delicate animals soon chafed and
presently died; we were then reduced to the Koroma or
half-reclaimed beast of Wanyamwezi. The laden asses
gave us even more trouble. The slaves would not attend
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-86">[86]</span>
to the girthing and the balancing of parcels&mdash;the great
secret of donkey-loading&mdash;consequently the burdens
were thrown at every mud or broken ground: the
unwilling Baloch only grumbled, sat down and stared,
leaving their Jemadars with Said bin Salim and ourselves
to reload. My companion and I brought up the
rear by alternate days, and sometimes we did not arrive
before the afternoon at the camping ground. The ropes
and cords intended to secure the herd were regularly
stolen, that I might be forced to buy others: the animals
were never pounded for the night, and during our illness
none of the party took the trouble to number them.
Thus several beasts were lost, and the grounding of the
Expedition appeared imminent and permanent. The
result was a sensation of wretchedness, hard to describe;
every morning dawned upon me with a fresh load of
cares and troubles, and every evening reminded me as
it closed in, that another and a miserable morrow was to
dawn. But “in despair,” as the Arabs say, “are many
hopes;” though sorrow endured for the night&mdash;and
many were “white” with anxiety&mdash;we never relinquished
the determination to risk everything, ourselves included,
rather than to return unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Dut’humi, one of the most fertile districts in K’hutu,
is a plain of black earth and sand, choked with vegetation
where not corrected by the axe. It is watered by
the perennial stream of the same name, which, rising
in the islands, adds its quotum to the waters of the
Mgazi, and eventually to the Mgeta and the Kingani
Rivers. In such places artificial irrigation is common,
the element being distributed over the fields by hollow
ridges. The mountains of Dut’humi form the northern
boundary of the plain. They appear to rise abruptly,
but they throw off southerly lower eminences, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-87">[87]</span>
diminish in elevation till confounded with the almost
horizontal surface of the champaign; the jagged broken
crests and peaks argue a primitive formation. Their
lay is to the N.N.W.; after four days’ journey, according
to the guides, they inosculate with the main chain
of the Usagara Mountains, and they are probably the
southern buttress of Ngu, or Nguru, the hill region
westward of Saadani. This chain is said to send forth
the Kingani River, which, gushing from a cave or fissure
in the eastern, is swollen to a large perennial stream by
feeders from the southern slopes, whilst the Mgeta flows
from the western face of the water-parting, and circles the
southern base. The cold temperature of these cloud-capped
and rainy crags, which never expose their outlines
except in the clearest weather, affects the plains;
by day bleak north-east and north-west gusts pour down
upon the sun-parched Dut’humi, and at night the thermometer
will sink to 70°, and even to 65° F. Water is
supposed to freeze upon the highlands, yet they are not
unhealthy; sheep, goats, and poultry abound; betel-pepper
grows there, according to the Arabs, and, as in
the lowlands, holcus and sesamum, manioc and sweet-potatoes
(Convolvulus batata), cucumbers, the turai
(Luffa acutangula), and beans, plantains, and sugar-cane,
are plentiful. The thick jungle at the base of the
hills shelters the elephant, the rhinoceros in considerable
numbers, the gnu, and the koodoo, which, however, can
rarely be found when the grass is high; a variety of the
ngole&mdash;a small Dendraspis&mdash;haunts the patriarchs of
the forest, and the chirrup of the mongoose, which the
people enjoy, as Europeans do the monotonous note of
the cricket, is heard in the brakes at eventide. This
part of the country, about six hours’ march northward
from Dut’humi, is called the Inland Magogoni; and it
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-88">[88]</span>
is traversed by the “Mdimu” nullah, which falls into
the Mgeta River. The fertile valleys in the lower and
southern folds are inhabited by the Wákumbáku(?),<a id="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
and by the Wásuop’hángá tribes; the higher elevations,
which apparently range from 3000 to 4000 feet, by the
Waruguru. They are compelled to fortify themselves
against the cold and the villanous races around them.
The plague of the land is now one Kisabengo, a Mzegura
of low origin, who, after conquering Ukami, a district
extending from the eastern flank of the Dut’humi hills
seawards, from its Moslem diwan, Ngozi, <i>alias</i> Kingaru,
has raised himself to the rank of a Shene Khambi, or
principal headman. Aided by the kidnapping Moslem
coast clans of Whinde, a small coast town opposite the
island of Zanzibar, and his fellow tribemen of Uzegura,
he has transferred by his frequent commandos almost
all the people of Ukámí, chiefly Wásuop’hángá and
Wárúgúrú, to the slave-market of Zanzibar, and, thus
compelled to push his depredations further west, he has
laid waste the lands even beyond the Mukondokwa river-valley.
The hill tribes, however, still receive strangers
hospitably into their villages. They have a place visited
even by distant Wazaramo pilgrims. It is described
as a cave where a P’hepo or the disembodied spirit of a
man, in fact a ghost, produces a terrible subterraneous
sound, called by the people Kurero or Bokero; it arises
probably from the flow of water underground. In a
pool in the cave women bathe for the blessing of issue,
and men sacrifice sheep and goats to obtain fruitful
seasons and success in war. These hill-races speak
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-89">[89]</span>
peculiar dialects, which, according to the guides, are
closely connected with Kik’hutu.</p>

<p>Despite the bad name of Dut’humi as regards climate,
Arabs sometimes reside there for some months for the
purpose of purchasing slaves cheaply and to repair their
broken fortunes for a fresh trip to the interior. This
keeps up a perpetual feud amongst the chiefs of the
country, and scarcely a month passes without fields
being laid waste, villages burnt down, and the unhappy
cultivators being carried off to be sold.</p>

<p>At Dut’humi a little expedition was sent against
Manda, a petty chief, who, despite the presence of the
Sayyid’s troops, had plundered a village and had kidnapped
five of the subjects of Mgota, his weaker neighbour.
I had the satisfaction of restoring the stolen
wretches to their hearths and homes, and two decrepid
old women that had been rescued from slavery thanked
me with tears of joy.</p>

<p>This easy good deed done, I was able, though with
swimming head and trembling hands, to prepare accounts
and a brief report of proceedings for the Royal Geographical
Society. These, together with other papers,
especially an urgent request for medical comforts and
drugs, especially quinine and narcotics, addressed to
Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, or, in case of accidents, to
M. Cochet, Consul de France, were entrusted to Jemadar
Yaruk, whom, moreover, I took the liberty of recommending
to the prince for the then vacant command
of the Bagamoyo garrison. The escort from Kaole,
reduced in number by three desertions, was dismissed.
All the volunteers had been clamouring to return, and
I could no longer afford to keep them. Besides the
two supplies of cloth, wire, and beads, which preceded,
and which were left to follow us, I had been provided
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-90">[90]</span>
by Ladha Damha with a stock of white and blue cottons,
some handsome articles of dress, 20,000 strings of white
and black, pink, blue, and green, red and brown porcelain-beads,
needles, and other articles of hardware, to
defray transit-charges through Uzarama. This provision,
valued at 295 dollars, should have carried us to
the end of the third month; it lasted about three weeks.
Said bin Salim, to whom it had been entrusted, had been
generous, through fear, to every half-naked barbarian
that chose to stretch forth the hand of beggary; moreover,
whilst too ill to superintend disbursements, he had
allowed his “children,” aided by the Baloch and the
“sons of Ramji,” to “loot” whatever they could seize
and secrete. Ladha Damha, unable to complete our
carriage, had hit upon the notable device of converting
eighteen pieces of American domestics into saddle-cloths
for the asses: the stuff was used at halts as bedding by
the Baloch and others; and,&mdash;a proof that much had
fallen into wrong hands,&mdash;the thirteen men composing
our permanent guard, increased the number of their
laden asses from two to five; moreover, for many weeks
afterwards, the “sons of Ramji” could afford to expend
four to five cloths upon a goat. On the 21st July the
escort from Kaole departed with a general discharge of
matchlocks. Their disappearance was hailed as a blessing;
they had pestered me for rations, and had begged
for asses till midnight. They were the refuse of their
service; they thought of, they dreamed of, nothing but
food; they would do no work; they were continually
attempting violence upon the timid Wak’hutu, and they
seemed resolved to make the name of Baloch equally
hateful and contemptible.</p>

<p>I had been careful to bring from Zanzibar four hammocks,
which, slung to poles, formed the conveyance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-91">[91]</span>
called by the Indians “manchil;” by the Portuguese
“manchila;” and in West Africa “tipoia.” Sayf bin
Salim agreed for the sum of ten dollars to hire his slaves
as porters for ourselves and our outfit. On the 24th
July, feeling strong enough to advance, we passed out of
the cultivation of Dut’humi. Crossing a steep and muddy
bed, knee-deep even in the dry season, we entered fields
under the outlying hillocks of the highlands. These low
cones, like similar formations in India, are not inhabited;
they are even more malarious than the plains, the surface
is rocky, and the woodage, not ceasing as in higher
elevations, extends from base to summit. Beyond the
cultivation the route plunges into a jungle, where the
European traveller realises every preconceived idea of
Africa’s aspect, at once hideous and grotesque. The
general appearance is a mingling of bush and forest,
which, contracting the horizon to a few yards, is equally
monotonous to the eye and palling to the imagination.
The black greasy ground, veiled with thick shrubbery,
supports in the more open spaces screens of tiger and
spear-grass, twelve and thirteen feet high, with every
blade a finger’s breadth; and the towering trees are
often clothed from root to twig with huge epiphytes,
forming heavy columns of densest verdure, and clustering
upon the tops in the semblance of enormous bird’s nests.
The foot-paths, in places “dead,”&mdash;as the natives say,&mdash;with
encroaching bush, are crossed by llianas, creepers
and climbers, thick as coir-cables, some connecting the
trees in a curved line, others stretched straight down the
trunks, others winding in all directions around their
supports, frequently crossing one another like network
and stunting the growth of even the vivacious calabash,
by coils like rope tightly encircling its neck. The earth,
ever rain-drenched, emits the odour of sulphuretted hydrogen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-92">[92]</span>
and in some parts the traveller might fancy a
corpse to be hidden behind every bush. To this sad
picture of miasma the firmament is a fitting frame: a
wild sky, whose heavy purple nimbi, chased by raffales
and chilling gusts, dissolve in large-dropped showers; or
a dull, dark grey expanse, which lies like a pall over the
world. In the finer weather the atmosphere is pale and
sickly; its mists and vapours seem to concentrate the
rays of the oppressive “rain-sun.” The sensation
experienced at once explains the apathy and indolence,
the physical debility, and the mental prostration, that
are the gifts of climates which moist heat and damp cold
render equally unsalubrious and uncomfortable. That
no feature of miasma might be wanting to complete the
picture, filthy heaps of the rudest hovels, built in holes
in the jungle, sheltered their few miserable inhabitants,
whose frames are lean with constant intoxication, and
whose limbs, distorted by ulcerous sores, attest the
hostility of Nature to mankind. Such a revolting scene
is East Africa from central K’hutu to the base of the
Usagara Mountains.</p>

<p>Running through this fetid flat the path passed on the
left sundry shallow salt-pits which, according to the
Arabs, are wet during the dry and dry during the wet
season. Presently after breaking through another fence
of holcus, whose cane was stiffer than the rattans of an
Indian jungle, we entered, and found lodgings in Bakera,
a pretty little hamlet ringed with papaws and
plantains, upon which the doves disported themselves.
Here, on our return in 1859, a thick growth of grass
waved over the ground-marks of hearth and roof-tree.
The African has a superstitious horror of stone walls; he
is still a semi-nomade, from the effects of the Wandertrieb,
or man’s vagabond instinct, uncurbed by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-93">[93]</span>
habits of civilisation. Though vestiges of large and
stable habitations have been discovered in the barbarous
Eastern Horn, in these days, between the parallels of
Harar and the ruined Portuguese towns near the Zambezi
Rivers, inner Africa ignores a town of masonry. In
our theoretical maps, the circlets used by cartographers
to denote cities serve only to mislead; their names
prove them to be Saltanats&mdash;lordships, districts or
provinces.</p>

<p>Resuming our course on the next day through
hollows and rice-swamps, where almost every ass fell or
cast its load, we came after a long tramp to the nearest
outposts of the Zungomero district; here were several
caravans with pitched tents, piles of ivory and crowds
of porters. The gang of thirty-six Wanyamwezi, who
had preceded us, having located themselves at a distant
hamlet, we resumed our march, and presently were met
by a number of our men headed by their guard, the
two “sons of Ramji.” Ensued a general sword and
spear play, each man with howls and cheers brandished
his blade or vibrated his missile, rushing about in all
directions, and dealing death amongst ideal foes with
such action as may often be observed in poultry-yards
when the hens indulge in a little merry pugnacity.
The march had occupied us four weeks, about double the
usual time, and the porters had naturally began to suspect
accidents from the Wazaramo.</p>

<p>Zungomero, the head of the great river-valley, is a
plain of black earth and sand, prodigiously fertile. It
is enclosed on all sides except the eastern, or the line of
drainage; northwards rise the peaks of Dut’humi; westwards
lie the little Wigo hills and the other spurs of Usagara,
uncultivated and uninhabited, though the country
is populous up to their feet; and southwards are detached
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-94">[94]</span>
cones of similar formation, steep, rocky, and densely
wooded. The sea-breeze is here strong, but beyond its
influence the atmosphere is sultry and oppressive;
owing to maritime influences the kosi, or south-west
wind, sometimes continues till the end of July. The
normal day, which varies little throughout the year,
begins with the light milky mist which forms the cloud-ring;
by degrees nimbi and cumuli come up from the
east, investing the heights of Dut’humi, and, when
showers are imminent, a heavy line of stratus bisects
the highlands and overlies the surface of the plain.
At the epochs of the lunar change rain falls once or
twice during the day and night, and, when the clouds
burst, a fiery sun sucks up poison from the earth’s
putridity. The early nights are oppressive, and towards
the dawn condensation causes a copious deposit of heavy
dew, which even the people of the country dread. A
prolonged halt causes general sickness amongst the
porters and slaves of a caravan. The humidity of the
atmosphere corrodes everything with which it comes in
contact; the springs of powder-flasks exposed to the
damp snap like toasted quills; clothes feel limp and
damp; paper, becoming soft and soppy by the loss of
glazing, acts as a blotter; boots, books, and botanical
collections are blackened; metals are ever rusty; the
best percussion caps, though labelled waterproof, will
not detonate unless carefully stowed away in waxed
cloth and tin boxes; gunpowder, if not kept from
the air, refuses to ignite; and wood becomes covered
with mildew. We had an abundance of common
German phosphor-matches, and the best English wax
lucifers; both, however, became equally unserviceable,
the heads shrank and sprang off at the least touch,
and the boxes frequently became a mere mass of paste.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-95">[95]</span>
To future travellers I should recommend the “good
old plan;” a bit of phosphorus in a little phial half full
of olive oil, which serves for light as well as ignition.
When accompanied by matchlock-men, however, there
is no difficulty about fire; their pouches always contain
a steel and flint, and a store of cotton, or of the wild
Bombex, dipped in saltpetre or gunpowder solution.</p>

<p>Yet Zungomero is the great Bandárí or centre of
traffic in the eastern, as are Unyanyembe and Ujiji in
the middle and the western regions. Lying upon the
main trunk-road, it must be traversed by the up and
down-caravans, and, during the travelling season, between
June and April, large bodies of some thousand
men pass through it every week. Kilwa formerly
sent caravans to it, and the Wanyamwezi porters have
frequently made that port by the “Mwera road.” The
Arab merchants usually pitch tents, preferring them
to the leaky native huts, full of hens and pigeons, rats
and mice, snakes and lizards, crickets and cockroaches,
gnats and flies, and spiders of hideous appearance, where
the inmates are often routed by swarms of bees, and
are ever in imminent danger of fires. The armed slaves
accompanying the caravan seize the best huts, which
they either monopolise or share with the hapless inmates,
and the porters stow themselves away under
the projecting eaves of the habitations. The main
attraction of the place is the plenty of provisions.
Grain is so abundant that the inhabitants exist almost
entirely upon the intoxicating pombe, or holcus-beer,&mdash;a
practice readily imitated by their visitors. Bhang
and the datura plant, growing wild, add to the attractions
of the spot. The Bhang is a fine large species of
the Cannabis Indica, the bang of Persia, the bhang of
India, and the benj of Arabia, the fasukh of northern,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-96">[96]</span>
and the dakha of southern Africa. In the low lands of
East Africa it grows before every cottage door. As in
hot climates generally, the fibre degenerates, and the
plant is only valued for its narcotic properties. The
Arabs smoke the sun-dried leaf with, and the Africans
without tobacco, in huge waterpipes, whose bowls contain
a quarter of a pound. Both ignore the more
luxurious preparations, momiya and hashish, ganja
and sebzi, charas and maajun. Like the “jangli” or
jungle (wild)-bhang of Sindh, affected by kalandars,
fakirs, and other holy beggars, this variety, contracting
the muscle of the throat, produces a violent whooping-cough,
ending in a kind of scream, after a few long
puffs, when the smoke is inhaled; and if one man sets
the example the others are sure to follow. These grotesque
sounds are probably not wholly natural; even
the boys may be heard practising them; they appear to
be a fashion of “renowning it”; in fact, an announcement
to the public that the fast youths are smoking
bhang. The Datura stramonium, called by the Arabs
and by the Wasawahili “muranhá,” grows in the well-watered
plains; it bears a large whitish flower and a
thorn-apple, like that of India. The heathen, as well
as their visitors, dry the leaves, the flowers, and the
rind of the rootlet, which is considered the strongest
preparation, and smoke them in a common bowl or in a
water-pipe. This is held to be a sovereign remedy
against zik el nafas (asthma) and influenza; it diminishes
the cough by loosening the phlegm. The
Washenzi never make that horrible use of the plant
known to the Indian dhaturiya, or datura-poisoners:
many accidents, however, occur from ignorance of its
violent narcotism. Meat is scarce: the only cattle are
those driven down by the Wanyamwezi to the coast;
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-97">[97]</span>
milk, butter, and ghee are consequently unprocurable. A
sheep or a goat will not cost less than a shukkah, or four
cubits of domestics, here worth twenty-five cents. The
same will purchase only two fowls; and eggs and fruit&mdash;chiefly
papaws and plantains, cocos and limes&mdash;are at
fancy prices. For the shukkah eight rations of unhusked
holcus, four measures of rice&mdash;which must here
be laid in by those travelling up-country&mdash;and five cakes
of tobacco, equal to about three pounds, are generally procurable.
Thus the daily expenditure of a large caravan
ranges from one dollar to one dollar fifty cents’ worth
of cloth in the Zanzibar market. The value, however,
fluctuates greatly, and the people will shirk selling even
at any price.</p>

<p>The same attractions which draw caravans to Zungomero
render it the great rendezvous of an army of
touters, who, whilst watching for the arrival of the
ivory traders, amuse themselves with plundering the
country. The plague has now spread like a flight of
locusts over the land. The Wak’hutu, a timid race, who,
unlike the Wazaramo, have no sultan to gather round,
are being gradually ousted from their ancient seats. In
a large village there will seldom be more than three or
four families, who occupy the most miserable hovels, all
the best having been seized by the touters or pulled
down for firewood. These men&mdash;slaves, escaped
criminals, and freemen of broken fortunes, flying from
misery, punishment, or death on the coast&mdash;are armed
with muskets and sabres, bows and spears, daggers and
knobsticks. They carry ammunition, and thus are too
strong for the country people. When rough language
and threats fail, the levelled barrel at once establishes
the right to a man’s house and property, to his wife and
children. If money runs short, a village is fired by
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-98">[98]</span>
night, and the people are sold off to the first caravan.
In some parts the pattering of musketry is incessant, as
it ever was in the turbulent states of Independent India.
It is rarely necessary to have recourse to violence, the
Wak’hutu, believing their tyrants to be emissaries, as
they represent themselves, from His Highness the
Sultan, and the chief nobles of Zanzibar, offer none
but the most passive resistance, hiding their families
and herds in the bush. Thus it happens that towards
the end of the year nothing but a little grain can be
purchased in a land of marvellous fertility.</p>

<p>As has been mentioned, these malpractices are severely
reprobated by His Highness the Sultan, and when the
evil passes a certain point remedial measures are taken.
A Banyan, for instance, is sent to the coast with warnings
to the Diwans concerned. But what care they for
his empty words, when they know that he has probably
equipped a similar party of black buccaneers himself?
and what hope can there be of reform when there is not
an honest man in the country to carry it out? Thus
the Government of Zanzibar is rendered powerless;&mdash;improvement
can be expected only from the hand of Time.
The Wak’hutu, indeed, often threaten a deputation to
entreat the Arab Sultan for protection in the shape of a
garrison of Baloch. This measure has been retarded
for sound reasons: no man dares to leave his house for
fear of finding it a ruin on his return; moreover, he
would certainly be shot if the touters guessed his intention,
and, even if he escaped this danger, he would
probably be sold, on the way to the coast, by his truculent
neighbours the Wazaramo. Finally, if they succeeded
in their wishes, would not a Baloch garrison act
the part of the man who, in the fable, was called in to
assist the horse against the stag? The Arabs, who know
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-99">[99]</span>
the temper of these mercenaries, are too wise ever to
sanction such a “dragonnade.”</p>

<p>The reader will readily perceive that he is upon the
slave-path, so different from travel amongst the free and
independent tribes of Southern Africa. The traffic practically
annihilates every better feeling of human nature.
Yet, though the state of the Wak’hutu appears pitiable,
the traveller cannot practise pity: he is ever in the
dilemma of maltreating or being maltreated. Were
he to deal civilly and liberally with this people he would
starve: it is vain to offer a price for even the necessaries
of life; it would certainly be refused because more is
wanted, and so on beyond the bounds of possibility.
Thus, if the touter did not seize a house, he would never
be allowed to take shelter in it from the storm; if he
did not enforce a “corvée,” he must labour beyond his
strength with his own hands; and if he did not fire a
village and sell the villagers, he might die of hunger in
the midst of plenty. Such in this province are the
action and reaction of the evil.</p>

<p class="noindent">Before bidding adieu to the Maritime Region, it will
be expedient to enter into a few details concerning its
geography and ethnology.<a id="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

Those who consider the subject worthy of further consideration are
referred, for an ampler account of it, to the Journal of the R. Geographical
Society, vol. xxix. of 1860.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The first or maritime region extends from the shores
of the Indian Ocean in <span class="smcap">E.</span> long. 39° to the mountain-chain
forming the land of Usagara in <span class="smcap">E.</span> long. 37° 28′; its
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-101">[101]</span>
breadth is therefore 92 geographical miles, measured in
rectilinear distance, and its mean length, bounded by the
waters of the Kingani and the Rufiji rivers, may be assumed
at 110. The average rise is under 4 feet per
mile. It is divided into two basins; that of the Kingani
easterly, and westward that of the Mgeta stream with
its many tributaries; the former, which is the principal,
is called the land of Uzaramo; the latter, which is of the
second order, contains the provinces of K’hutu, by the
Arabs pronounced Kutu, and Uziraha, a minor district.
The natives of the country divide it into the three lowlands
of Tunda, Dut’humi, and Zungomero.</p>

<p>The present road runs with few and unimportant deviations
along the whole length of the fluviatile valleys
of the Kingani and the Mgeta. Native caravans if
lightly laden generally accomplish the march in a fortnight,
one halt included. On both sides of this line,
whose greatest height above the sea-level was found by
<span class="smcapall">B. P.</span> therm. to be 330 feet, rises the rolling ground, which
is the general character of the country. Its undulations
present no eminences worthy of notice; near the
sea they are short and steep, further inland they roll in
longer waves, and everywhere they are covered with
abundant and luxuriant vegetation, the result of decomposition
upon the richest soil. In parts there is an
appearance of park land; bushless and scattered forests,
with grass rising almost to the lower branches of the
smaller thorns; here and there clumps and patches of impassable
shrubbery cluster round knots and knolls of
majestic and thickly foliaged trees. The narrow footpaths
connecting the villages often plunge into dark
and dense tunnels formed by overarching branch and
bough, which delay the file of laden porters; the mud
lingering long after a fall of rain in these low
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-102">[102]</span>
grounds fills them with a chilly clammy atmosphere.
Merchants traverse such spots with trembling; in these,
the proper places for ambuscade, a few determined men
easily plunder a caravan by opposing it in front or by
an attack in rear. The ways are often intersected
by deep nullahs and water-courses, dry during the hot
season, but unfordable when rain falls. In the many
clearings, tobacco, maize, holcus, sesamum, and ground-nuts,
manioc, beans, pulse, and sweet potatoes flourish;
the pine-apple is a weed, and a few cocos and mangoes,
papaws, jack-fruit, plantains, and limes are scattered
over the districts near the sea. Rice grows abundantly
in the lower levels. The villages are hidden deep in the
bush or grass: the crowing of the cocks heard all along
the road, except in the greater stretches of wilderness,
proves them to be numerous; they are, however
small and thinly populated. The versant, as usual in
maritime E. Africa, trends towards the Indian Ocean.
Water abounds even at a distance from the rivers; it
springs from the soil in diminutive runnels and lies in
“shimo” or pits, varying from surface-depth to 10 feet.
The monsoon-rains, which are heavy, commence in
March, about a month earlier than in Zanzibar, and the
duration is similar. The climate of the higher lands is
somewhat superior to that of the valley, but it is still
hot and oppressive. The formation, after passing from
the corallines, the limestones, the calcareous tuffs, and
the rude gravelly conglomerates of the coast, is purely
primitive and sandstone: erratic blocks of fine black
hornblende and hornblendic rock, used by the people as
whetstones and grinding-slabs, abound in the river-beds,
which also supply the clay used for pottery. The subsoil
is near the sea a stiff blue loam, in the interior a
ruddy quartzose gravel; the soil is a rich brown or black
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-103">[103]</span>
humus, here and there coated with, or varied by, clean
white sand, and in some parts are seams of reddish loam.
Fresh-water shells are scattered over the surface, and
land-crabs burrow in the looser earths where stone
seldom appears. Black cattle are unknown in the maritime
region, but poultry, sheep, and goats are plentiful:
near the jungle they are protected from the leopards or
ounces by large wooden huts, like cages, raised on piles
for cleanliness.</p>

<p>As a rule, the fluviatile valleys resemble in most
points the physical features of the coast and island of
Zanzibar: the general aspect of the country, however&mdash;the
expression of its climate&mdash;undergoes some modifications.
Near the sea, the basin is a broad winding
line, traversed by the serpentine river, whose bed is
now too deep for change. About the middle expanse
stony ridges and rocky hills crop out from the
rolling ground, and the head of the valley is a low continuous
plain. In many places, especially near the
estuary, river-terraces, like road embankments, here converging,
there diverging, indicate by lines and strews of
water-worn pebbles and sea-shells the secular uprise of
the country and the declension of the stream to its present
level. These raised seabeaches at a distance appear
crowned with dwarf rounded cones which, overgrown
with lofty trees, are favourite sites for settlements. In
the lower lands the jungle and the cultivation are of the
rankest and most gigantic description, the effect of a
damp, hot region, where atmospheric pressure is excessive.
The grass, especially that produced by the black
soils in the swamps and marshes, rises to the height of
12-13 feet, and serves to conceal runaway slaves and
malefactors: the stalks vary in thickness from a goose-quill
to a man’s finger. The larger growths, which are
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-104">[104]</span>
so closely planted that they conceal the soil, cannot be
traversed without paths, and even where these exist the
traveller must fight his way through a dense screen, receiving
from time to time a severe blow when the reeds
recoil, or a painful thrust from some broken and inclined
stump. Even the horny sole of the sandal-less African
cannot tread these places without being cut or staked,
and everywhere a ride through these grass-avenues whilst
still dripping with the cold exhalations of night, with the
sun beating fiercely upon the upper part of the body, is
a severe infliction to any man not in perfect health. The
beds of streams and nullahs are sometimes veiled by the
growth of the banks. These crops spring up with the
rains, and are burned down by hunters, or more frequently
by accident, after about a month of dry weather;
in the interim fires are dangerous: the custom is to beat
down the blaze with leafy boughs. Such is the variety
of species that in some parts of the river-valleys each day
introduces the traveller to a grass before unseen. Where
the inundations lie long, the trees are rare, and those
that exist are slightly raised by mounds above the ground
to escape the destructive effects of protracted submergence:
in these places the decomposed vegetation exhales
a fetid odour. Where the waters soon subside
there are clumps of tall shrubbery and seams of forest
rising on extensive meadows of grassy land, which give
it the semblance of a suite of natural parks or pleasure-grounds,
and the effect is not diminished by the frequent
herds of gnu and antelope prancing and pacing over their
pastures.</p>

<p>The climate is hot and oppressive, and the daily sea-breeze,
which extends to the head of the Mgeta valley,
is lost in the lower levels. About Zungomero rain is
constant, except for a single fortnight in the month of
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-105">[105]</span>
January; it seems to the stranger as if the crops must
infallibly decay, but they do not. At most times the
sun, even at its greatest northern declination, shines
through a veil of mist with a sickly blaze and a blistering
heat, and the overcharge of electricity is evidenced
by frequent and violent thunder-storms. In the western
parts cold and cutting breezes descend from the rugged
crags of Dut’humi.</p>

<p>The principal diseases of the valley are severe ulcerations
and fevers, generally of a tertian type. The
“Mkunguru” begins with coldness in the toes and
finger-tips; a frigid shiver seems to creep up the legs,
followed by pains in the shoulders, severe frontal headache,
hot eyes, and a prostration and irritability of mind
and body. This preliminary lasts for one to three
hours, when nausea ushers in the hot stage: the head
burns, the action of the heart becomes violent, thirst
rages, and a painful weight presses upon the eyeballs:
it is often accompanied by a violent cough and irritation.
Strange visions, as in delirium, appear to the
patient, and the excitement of the brain is proved by
unusual loquacity. When the fit passes off with copious
perspiration the head is often affected, the ears buzz, and
the limbs are weak. If the patient attempts to rise
suddenly, he feels a dizziness, produced apparently by a
gush of bile along the liver duct: want of appetite,
sleeplessness and despondency, and a low fever, evidenced
by hot pulses, throbbing temples, and feet painfully
swollen, with eruptions of various kinds, and ulcerated
mouth, usher in the cure. This fever yields easily to
mild remedies, but it is capable of lasting three weeks.</p>

<p>A multitude of roads, whose point of departure is
the coast, form a triangle and converge at the “Makutaniro,”
or junction-place, in Central Uzaramo. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-106">[106]</span>
route whose several stations have been described is
one of the main lines running from Kaole and Bagamoyo,
in a general southwest direction, till it falls into
the great trunk road which leads directly west from
Mbuamaji. It is divided into thirteen caravan stages,
but a well-girt walker will accomplish the distance in
a week.</p>

<p>No apology is offered for the lengthiness of the ethnographical
descriptions contained in the following pages.
The ethnology of Africa is indeed its most interesting,
if not its only interesting feature. Everything connected
with the habits and customs, the moral and religious,
the social and commercial state of these new races,
is worthy of diligent observation, careful description, and
minute illustration. There is indeed little in the physical
features of this portion of the great peninsula to excite
the attention of the reader beyond the satisfaction that
ever accompanies the victory of truth over fable, and a
certain importance which in these “travelling times,”&mdash;when
man appears rapidly rising to the rank of a migratory
animal,&mdash;must attach to discovery. The subject, indeed,
mostly banishes ornament. Lying under the same
parallels with a climate whose thermical variations know
no extremes, the succession of alluvial valley, ghaut,
table-land, and shelving plain is necessarily monotonous,
the soil is the same, the productions are similar, and the
rocks and trees resemble one another. Eastern and
central inter-tropical Africa also lacks antiquarian and
historic interest, it has few traditions, no annals, and no
ruins, the hoary remnants of past splendour so dear to
the traveller and to the reader of travels. It contains not
a single useful or ornamental work, a canal or a dam is,
and has ever been, beyond the narrow bounds of its
civilisation. It wants even the scenes of barbaric pomp
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-107">[107]</span>
and savage grandeur with which the student of occidental
Africa is familiar. But its ethnography has novelties:
it exposes strange manners and customs, its Fetichism is
in itself a wonder, its commerce deserves attention, and
its social state is full of mournful interest. The fastidiousness
of the age, however, forbidding ampler details,
even under the veil of the “learned languages,”
cripples the physiologist, and robs the subject of its
principal peculiarities. I have often regretted that if
Greek and dog-Latin be no longer a sufficient disguise
for the facts of natural history, human and bestial, the
learned have not favoured us with a system of symbols
which might do away with the grossness of words.</p>

<p>The present tenants of the First Region are the
Wazaramo, the Wak’hutu, and their great sub-tribe, the
Waziraha; these form the staple of population,&mdash;the
Wadoe and the Wazegura being minor and immigrant
tribes.</p>

<p>The Wazaramo are no exception to the rule of barbarian
maritime races: they have, like the Somal, the
Gallas, the Wangindo, the Wamakua, and the Cape Kafirs,
come into contact with a civilisation sufficiently powerful
to corrupt without subjugating them; and though cultivators
of the ground, they are more dreaded by caravans
than any tribe from the coast to the Lake Region. They
are bounded eastward by the thin line of Moslems in the
maritime regions, westward by the Wak’hutu, northward
by the Kingani River, and on the south by the tribes of
the Rufiji. The Wazaramo, or, as they often pronounce
their own name, Wazalamo, claim connection with the
semi-nomade Wakamba, who have, within the last few
years, migrated to the north-west of Mombasah. Their
dialect, however, proves them to be congeners of
the Wak’hutu, and distinct from the Wakamba. As in
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-108">[108]</span>
East Africa generally, it is impossible to form the remotest
idea of the number of families, or of the total of
population. The Wazaramo number many sub-tribes,
the principal of which are the Wákámbá and the Wáp’hangárá.</p>

<p>These negroids are able-bodied men, tall and straight,
compared with the Coast-clans, but they are inferior in
development to most of the inner tribes. The complexion,
as usual, varies greatly. The chiefs are often
coal-black, and but few are of light colour. This arises
from the country being a slave-importer rather than
exporter; and here, as among the Arabs, black skins
are greatly preferred. The Mzaramo never circumcises,
except when becoming a “Mháji,” or Moslem convert;
nor does this tribe generally tattoo, though some adorn
the face with three long cicatrized cuts, like the Mashali
of Mecca, extending down each cheek from the ear-lobes
to the corners of the mouth. Their distinctive mark is
the peculiarity of dressing their hair. The thick wool
is plastered over with a cap-like coating of ochreish and
micaceous clay, brought from the hills, and mixed to
the consistency of honey with the oil of the sesamum
or the castor-bean. The pomatum, before drying, is
pulled out with the fingers to the ends of many little
twists, which circle the head horizontally, and the mass is
separated into a single or a double line of knobs, the
upper being above, and the lower below, the ears, both look
stiff and matted, as if affected with a bad plica polonica.
The contrast between these garlands of small red dilberries
and the glossy black skin is, however, effective. The
clay, when dry, is washed out with great trouble by
means of warm water&mdash;soap has yet to be invented&mdash;and
by persevering combing with the fingers. Women wear
the hair-thatch like men; there are, however, several
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-109">[109]</span>
styles. It is usually parted in the centre, from the
crinal front-line to the nape of the neck, and allowed to
grow in a single or double dense thatch, ridging the
head breadthwise from ear to ear: this is coloured or
not coloured, according to the wearer’s taste. Some of
the Wazaramo, again, train lumps of their wool to rise
above the region of cautiousness, and very exactly
simulate bears’ ears. The face is usually lozenge-shaped,
the eyes are somewhat oblique, the nose is flat and patulated,
the lips tumid and everted, the jaw prognathous,
and the beard, except in a few individuals, is scanty.
The sebaceous odour of the skin amongst all these races
is overpowering: emitted with the greatest effect during
and after excitement either of mind or body, it connects
the negroid with the negro and separates him from the
Somal, the Galla, and the Malagash. The expression of
countenance is wild and staring, the features are coarse
and harsh, the gait is loose and lounging; the Arab strut
and the Indian swagger are unknown in East Africa. The
Wazaramo tribe is rich in albinos; three were seen by the
Expedition in the course of a single day. They much
resemble Europeans of the leucous complexion; the
face is quite bald; the skin is rough, and easily wrinkles
in long lines, marked by a deeper pink; the hair is
short, sharp-curling, and coloured like a silk-worm’s
cocoon, and the lips are red. The eyes have grey
pupils and rosy “whites:” they appear very sensitive
to light, and are puckered up so as to distort the countenance.
The features are unusually plain, and the stature
appears to range below the average. The people who
have no prejudice against them, call these leucœthiops
Wazungu, “white men.”</p>

<p>The Wazaramo tribe is wealthy enough to dress well:
almost every man can afford a shukkah or loin-cloth of
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-110">[110]</span>
unbleached cotton, which he stains a dirty yellow, like the
Indian gerua, with a clay dug in the subsoil. Their
ornaments are extensive girdles and bead necklaces of
various colours, white disks, made from the base of a
sea-shell, and worn single on the forehead or in pairs at
the neck. A massy ring of brass or zinc encircles the
wrist. The decoration peculiar to the tribe, and common
to both sexes, is the mgoweko, a tight collar or
cravat, 1 to 1·50 inches broad, of red and yellow, white
and black beads, with cross-bars of different colours at
short intervals. Men never appear in public without
an ostentatious display of arms. The usual weapons,
when they cannot procure muskets, are spears, bows,
and arrows, the latter poisoned, and sime, or long knives
like the Somali daggers, made by themselves with imported
iron. The chiefs are generally seen in handsome
attire; embroidered Surat caps bound with a tight
snowy turban of a true African shape, which contrasts
well with black skins and the short double-peaked beards
below. The body-garment is a loin-cloth of showy Indian
cotton or Arab check; some prefer the long shirt
and the kizbao or waistcoat affected by the slaves at
Zanzibar. The women are well dressed as the men&mdash;a
circumstance rare in East Africa. Many of them
have the tibia bowed in front by bearing heavy water-pots
at too early an age; when not burdened they have
a curious mincing gate, they never veil their faces, and
they show no shame in the presence of strangers. The
child is carried in a cloth at the back.</p>

<p>The habitations of the Wazaramo are far superior in
shape and size to those of K’hutu, and, indeed, to any
on this side of Unyamwezi. Their buildings generally
resemble the humbler sort of English cow-house, or an
Anglo-Indian bungalow. In poorer houses the outer
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-111">[111]</span>
walls are of holcus canes, rudely puddled; the better
description are built of long and broad sheets of Myombo
and Mkora bark, propped against strong uprights
inside, and bound horizontally by split bamboos tied outside
with fibrous cord. The heavy pent-shaped roof
often provided with a double thatch of grass and reeds,
projects eaves, which are high enough to admit a man
without stooping; these are supported by a long cross
bar resting on perpendiculars, tree-trunks, barked and
smoothed, forked above, and firmly planted in the
ground. Along the outer marginal length of this
verandah lies a border of large logs polished by long
sittings. The interior is dark and windowless, and
party-walls of stiff grass-cane divide it into several compartments.
The list of furniture comprises a dwarf
cartel about 4 feet long by 16 inches broad, upon which
even the married couple manages to make itself comfortable;
a stool cut out of a single block, a huge wooden
mortar, mtungi or black earthen pots, gourds, ladles of
cocoa-nut, cast-off clothes, whetstones, weapons, nets, and
in some places creels for fishing. Grain is ground upon
an inclined slab of fine-grained granite or syenite, sometimes
loose, at other times fixed in the ground with a
mud plaster; the classical Eastern handmill is unknown
in this part of Africa. The inner roof and its rafters,
shining with a greasy soot, in wet weather admit drenching
lines of leakage, and the only artifice applied to the
flooring is the tread of the proprietors. The door is a
close hurdle of parallel holcus-straw bound to five or
six cross-bars with strips of bark. In a village there
will be from four to twelve “bungalows;” the rest are
the normal haycock and beehive hut of Africa. Where
enemies are numerous the settlements are palisaded;
each has, moreover, but a single entrance, which is approached
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-112">[112]</span>
by a narrow alley of strong stockade, and is
guarded by a thick planking that fits into a doorway
large enough to admit cattle.</p>

<p>The Wazaramo are an ill-conditioned, noisy, boisterous
violent, and impracticable race. A few years ago they
were the principal obstacle to Arab and other travellers
entering into East Africa. But the seizure of Kaole and
other settlements by the late Sayyid of Zanzibar has
now given strangers a footing in the land. After tasting
the sweets of gain, they have somewhat relented; but
quarrels between them and the caravans are still frequent.
The P’házi, or chief of the district, demands a
certain amount of cloth for free passage from all merchants
on their way to the interior; from those returning
he takes cattle, jembe, or iron hoes, shokah or
hatchets, in fact, whatever he can obtain. If not contented,
his clansmen lie in ambush and discharge a few
poisoned arrows at the trespassers: they never have
attempted, like the Wagogo, to annihilate a caravan; in
fact, the loss of one of their number causes a general
panic. They have hitherto successfully resisted the little
armies of touters that have almost desolated K’hutu, and
they are frequently in hostilities with the coast settlements.
The young men sometimes set out on secret
plundering expeditions to Bagamoyo and Mbuamaji, and
enter the houses at night by mining under the walls.
The burghers attempt to defeat them by burying stones
and large logs as a foundation, but in vain: their
superior dexterity has originated a superstitious notion
that they possess a peculiar “medicine,” a magic spell
called “Ugumba,” which throws the household into a
deep trance. When a thief is caught <i>in flagrante delicto</i>,
his head soon adorns a tall pole at the entrance of the
settlement: it is not uncommon to see half a dozen
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-113">[113]</span>
bloody or bleached fragments of humanity collected in a
single spot. When disposed to be friendly the Wazaramo
will act as porters to Arabs, but if a man die his
load is at once confiscated by his relatives, who, however,
insist upon receiving his blood-money, as if he had
been slain in battle. Their behaviour to caravans in
their own country depends upon the strangers’ strength;
many trading bodies therefore unite into one before
beginning the transit, and even then they are never
without fear.</p>

<p>The Wazaramo chiefs are powerful only when their
wealth or personal qualities win the respect of their
unruly republican subjects. There are no less than five
orders in this hereditary master-class. The P’hazi is the
headman of the village, and the Mwene Goha is his principal
councillor; under these are three ranks of elders,
the Kinyongoni, the Chúmá, and the Káwámbwá. The
headman, unless exceptionally influential, must divide
amongst his “ministry” the blackmail extorted from travellers.
The P’hazi usually fills a small village with
his wives and families; he has also large estates, and he
personally superintends the labour of his slave-gangs.
He cannot sell his subjects except for two offences&mdash;Ugoni
or adultery, and Ucháwe or black magic. The
latter crime is usually punished by the stake; in some
parts of the country the roadside shows at every few
miles a heap or two of ashes with a few calcined and
blackened human bones mixed with bits of half-consumed
charcoal, telling the tragedy that has been enacted
there. The prospect cannot be contemplated without
horror; here and there, close to the larger circles where
the father and mother have been burnt, a smaller heap
shows that some wretched child has shared their terrible
fate, lest growing up he should follow in his parents’ path.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-114">[114]</span>
The power of conviction is wholly in the hands of the
Mgángá or medicine-man, who administers an ordeal
called Bága or Kyápo by boiling water. If the hand
after being dipped show any sign of lesion, the offence
is proven, and the sentence is instantly carried into execution.</p>

<p>Instinctively conscious of their moral wants, the
Washenzi throughout this portion of East Africa have
organised certain customs which have grown to laws.
The first is the Sáre or brother oath. Like the
“manred” of Scotland, the “munh bola bhai” of India,
and similar fraternal institutions amongst most of the ancient
tribes of barbarians in whom sociability is a passion,
it tends to reconcile separate interests between man and
man, to modify the feuds and discords of savage society,
and, principally, to strengthen those that need an alliance.
In fact, it is a contrivance for choosing relations instead of
allowing Nature to force them upon man, and the flimsiness
of the tie between brothers born in polygamy has
doubtless tended to perpetuate it. The ceremony, which
is confined to adults of the male sex, is differently performed
in the different tribes. Amongst the Wazaramo,
the Wazegura, and the Wasagara, the two “brothers”
sit on a hide face to face, with legs outstretched to the
front and overlapping one another; their bows and
arrows are placed across their thighs, whilst a third person,
waving a sword over their heads, vociferates curses
against any one that may “break the brotherhood.” A
sheep is then slaughtered, and its flesh, or more often its
heart, is brought roasted to the pair, who, having made
with a dagger incisions in each other’s breasts close to
the pit of the stomach, eat a piece of meat smeared with
the blood. Among the Wanyamwezi and the Wajiji the
cut is made below the left ribs or above the knee; each
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-115">[115]</span>
man receives in a leaf his brother’s blood, which, mixed
with oil or butter, he rubs into his own wound. An
exchange of small presents generally concludes the rite.
It is a strong tie, as all men believe that death or
slavery would follow its infraction. The Arabs, to whom
the tasting of blood is unlawful, usually perform it by
proxy. The slave “Fundi,” or fattori, of the caravans
become brothers, even with the Washenzi, whenever
they expect an opportunity of utilising the relationship.</p>

<p>The second custom is more peculiar. The East African
dares not appropriate an article found upon the road,
especially if he suspect that it belongs to a fellow tribeman.
He believes that a “Kigámbo,” an unexpected
calamity, slavery or death, would follow the breach of
this custom. At Zungomero a watch, belonging to the
Expedition, was picked up by the country people in the
jungle, and was punctually returned, well wrapped round
with grass and leaves. But subsequent experience makes
the traveller regret that the superstition is not of a
somewhat more catholic and comprehensive character.</p>

<p>The religion of the East African will be treated of in
a future page. The Wazaramo, like their congeners,
are as little troubled with ceremony as with belief. In
things spiritual as in things temporal they listen to but
one voice, that of “Ádá,” or custom. The most offensive
scoffer or sceptic in Europe is not regarded with
more abomination than the man who in these lands would
attempt to touch a jot or tittle of Ádá.</p>

<p>There are no ceremonies on birth-occasions and no
purification of women amongst these people. In the
case of abortion or of a still-born child they say, “he
hath returned,” that is to say, to home in earth. When
the mother perishes in childbirth, the parents claim a
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-116">[116]</span>
certain sum from “the man that killed their daughter.”
Neither on the continent nor at Zanzibar do they bind with
cloth the head of the new-born babe. Twins, here called
Wápáchá, and by the Arabs of Zanzibar, Shukúl (‏شكول‎)
are usually sold or exposed in the jungle as amongst the
Ibos of West Africa. If the child die, an animal is
killed for a general feast, and in some tribes the mother
does a kind of penance. Seated outside the village, she
is smeared, with fat and flour, and exposed to the derision
of people who surround her, hooting and mocking
with offensive jests and gestures. To guard against this
calamity, the Wazaramo and other tribes are in the habit
of vowing that the babe shall not be shaved till manhood,
and the mother wears a number of talismans, bits of
wood tied, with a thong of snake’s skin, round her neck,
and beads of different shapes round her head. When
carrying her offspring, which she rarely leaves alone,
she bears in her hand what is technically called a kirangozi,
a “guide” or “guardian,” in the form of two sticks
a few inches in length, bound with bands of particoloured
beads. This article, made up by the Mgángá or medicine-man,
is placed at night under the child’s head, and
is carried about till it has passed the first stage of life.
The kirangozi is intended to guard the treasure against
the malevolent spirits of the dead; that almost universal
superstition, the Evil Eye, though an article of faith
amongst the Arabs, the Wasawahili, and the Wamrima,
is unknown to the inner heathen.</p>

<p>A name is given to the child without other celebration
than a debauch with pombe: this will sometimes occur
at the birth of a male, when he is wanted. The East
Africans, having few national prejudices, are fond of
calling their children after Arabs and other strangers:
they will even pay a sheep for the loan of a merchant’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-117">[117]</span>
name. There must be many hundred Sayyid Saids and
Sayyid Majids now in the country; and as during the
eighteen months’ peregrination of the East African Expedition
every child born on and near the great trunk-line
was called Muzungu&mdash;the “white”&mdash;the Englishman
has also left his mark in the land. The period of ablactation,
as in South Africa, is prolonged to the second or third
year: may this account, in part, for the healthiness of the
young and the almost total absence of debility and deformity?
Indeed, the nearest approach to the latter is
the unsightly protrusion of the umbilical region, sometimes
to the extent of several inches, owing to ignorance
of proper treatment; but, though conspicuous in childhood,
it disappears after puberty. Women retain the
power of suckling their children to a late age, even when
they appear withered grandames. Until the child can
walk without danger, it is carried by the mother, not
on the hip, as in Asia, but on the bare back for warmth,
a sheet or skin being passed over it and fastened at
the parent’s breast. Even in infancy it clings like a
young simiad, and the peculiar formation of the African
race renders the position easier by providing a kind of seat
upon which it subsides; the only part of the body exposed
to view is the little coco-nut head, with the small, round,
beady black eyes in a state of everlasting stare. Finally,
the “kigogo,” or child who cuts the two upper incisors
before the lower, is either put to death, or is given away
or sold to the slave-merchant, under the impression that
it will bring disease, calamity, and death into the household.
The Wasawahili and the Zanzibar Arabs have
the same impressions: the former kill the child; the latter,
after a Khitmah or perlection of the Koran, make
it swear, by nodding its head if unable to articulate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-118">[118]</span>
that it will not injure those about it. Even in
Europe, it may be remembered, the old prejudice against
children born with teeth is not wholly forgotten.</p>

<p>Amongst the Wazaramo there is no limitation to the
number of wives, except the expense of wedding and the
difficulty of supporting a large establishment. Divorce is
signified by presenting to the wife a piece of holcus-cane:
if a sensible woman she at once leaves the house, and, if
not, she is forced to leave. There is no more romance
in the affair even before marriage than in buying a goat.
The marriageable youth sends a friend to propose to the
father: if the latter consents, his first step is, not to
consult his daughter&mdash;such a proceeding would be
deemed the act of a madman&mdash;but to secure for himself
as many cloths as possible, from six to twelve, or
even more, besides a preliminary present which goes by
the name of kiremba (kilemba), his “turban.” This,
however, is a kind of settlement which is demanded
back if the wife die without issue; but if she bear children,
it is preserved for them by their grand-parents.
After the father the mother puts in her claim in behalf
of the daughter; she requires a kondáví, or broad parti-coloured
band of beads worn round the waist and next
the skin; her mukájyá or loin-cloth, and her wereko, or
sheet in which the child is borne upon the back. In the
interior the settlement is made in live-stock, varying from
a few goats to a dozen cows. This weighty point duly
determined, the husband leads his wife to his own home,
an event celebrated by drumming, dancing, and extensive
drunkenness. The children born in wedlock belong
to the father.</p>

<p>When a man or a woman is at the point of death, the
friends assemble, and the softer sex sometimes sings,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-119">[119]</span>
howls, and weeps: the departing is allowed to depart life
upon the kitanda, or cartel. There is, however, little demonstrative
sorrow amongst these people, and, having the
utmost dread of disembodied spirits, all are anxious to
get rid of the corpse and its appertainings. The Wazaramo,
more civilised than their neighbours, bury their
dead stretched out and in the dress worn during life:
their graves have already been described.</p>

<p>The “industry” of Usaramo will occupy but few sentences.
Before the great rains of the year set in the
land must be weeded, and scratches must be made with
a hoe for the reception of seed. The wet season ushers
in the period for copal digging: the proceeds are either
sold to travelling traders, or are carried down to the
coast in mákándá&mdash;mat-sacks&mdash;of light weight, and
are sold to the Banyans. Bargaining and huckstering,
cheapening and chaffering, are ever the African’s highest
intellectual enjoyments, and he does not fail to stretch
them to their utmost limits. After the autumnal rains
during the Azyab, or the north-east monsoon, the grass
is fired, when the men seizing their bows, arrows, and
spears, indiscriminately slaughter beast and bird&mdash;an
operation which, yearly repeated, accounts in part for the
scarcity of animal life so remarkable in this animal’s
paradise. When all trades fail, the Mzaramo repairs to
the coast, where, despite his bad name, he usually finds
employment as a labourer.</p>

<p>Next in order to the maritime Wazaramo are the
Wak’hutu, to whom many of the observations upon the
subject of their more powerful neighbours equally apply.
Their territory extends from the Mgeta River to the
mountains of Usagara, and in breadth from the Dut’humi
Highlands to the Rufiji River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-120">[120]</span></p>

<p>The Wak’hutu are physically and, apparently, mentally
a race inferior to the Wazaramo; they are very
dark, and bear other marks of a degradation effected
by pernicious climatory conditions. They have no
peculiar tattoo, although individuals raise complicated
patterns in small cicatrices upon their breasts. The popular
head-dress is the clay-coating of the Wazaramo, of
somewhat modified dimensions; and some of them,
who are possibly derived from the Wahiao and other
southern clans, have a practice&mdash;exceptional in these
latitudes&mdash;of chipping their incisors to sharp points,
which imitate well enough the armature of the reptilia.
Their eyes are bleared and red with perpetual intoxication,
and they seem to have no amusements but
dancing and singing through half the night. None
but the wealthier can afford to wear cloth; the substitute
is a kilt of the calabash fibre, attached by a cord
of the same material to the waist. In women it often
narrows to a span, and would be inadequate to the
purposes of decency were it not assisted by an underclothing
of softened goatskin; this and a square of
leather upon the bosom, which, however, is often
omitted, compose the dress of the multitude. The ornaments
are like those of the Wazaramo, but by no means
so numerous. The Wak’hutu live poorly, and, having
no ghee, are contented with the oil of the sesamum and
the castor-bean with their holcus porridge. The rivers
supply them with the usual mud-fish; at times they
kill game. Their sheep, goats, and poultry they reserve
for barter on the coast; and, though bees swarm throughout
the land, and even enter the villages, they will not
take the trouble to make hives.</p>

<p>As on the Mrima, the proportion of chiefs to subjects
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-121">[121]</span>
seems to increase in the inverse ratio of what is required.
Every district in K’hutu has its P’hazi or headman, with
his minister the Mwene Goha, and inferior chiefs, the
Chándumé, the Muwinge, and the Mbárá. These men live
chiefly upon the produce of their fields, which they sell to
caravans; they are too abject and timid to insist upon
the blackmail which has caused so many skirmishes in
Uzaramo; and the only use that they make of their
power is to tyrannise over their villages, and occasionally
to organise a little kidnapping. With the aid of slavery
and black magic they render their subjects’ lives as precarious
as they well can: no one, especially in old age,
is safe from being burnt at a day’s notice. They are
civil to strangers, but wholly unable to mediate between
them and the tribe. The Wak’hutu have been used as
porters; but they have proved so treacherous, and so
determined to desert, that no man will trust them in a
land where prepayment is the first condition of an
agreement. Property amongst them is insecure: a man
has always a vested right in his sister’s children; and
when he dies his brothers and relations carefully plunder
his widow and orphans.</p>

<p>The dirty, slovenly villages of the Wak’hutu are an
index of the character of the people. Unlike the comfortable
cottages of the coast, and the roomy abodes of
the Wazaramo, the settlements of the Wak’hutu are composed
of a few straggling hovels of the humblest description&mdash;with
doors little higher than an English
pigsty, and eaves so low that a man cannot enter them
except on all fours. In shape they differ, some being
simple cones, others like European haystacks, and others
like our old straw beehives. The common hut is a circle
from 12 to 25 feet in diameter; those belonging to the
chiefs are sometimes of considerable size, and the first
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-122">[122]</span>
part of the erection is a cylindrical framework composed
of tall stakes, or the rough trunks of young trees, interwoven
with parallel and concentric rings of flexible twigs
and withies, which are coated inside and outside with
puddle of red or grey clay. In some a second circle of wall
is built round the inner cylinder, thus forming one house
within the other. The roof, subsequently added, is of
sticks and wattles, and the weight rests chiefly upon a
central tree. It has eaves-like projections, forming a
narrow verandah, edged with horizontal bars which
rest upon forked uprights. Over the sticks interwoven
with the frame, thick grass or palm-fronds are thrown,
and the whole is covered with a coat of thatch tied on
with strips of tree bark. During the first few minutes
of heavy rain, this roofing, shrunk by the parching suns,
admits water enough to patch the interior with mud.
The furniture of the cottages is like that of the Wazaramo;
and the few square feet which compose the area
are divided by screens of wattle into dark pigeon-holes,
used as stores, kitchen, and sleeping-rooms. A thick
field of high grass is allowed to grow in the neighbourhood
of each village, to baffle pursuers in case of need;
and some cottages are provided with double doorways
for easier flight. In the middle of the settlement there is
usually a tall tree, under which the men lounge upon
cots scarcely large enough for an English child; and
where the slaves, wrangling and laughing, husk their
holcus in huge wooden mortars. These villages can
scarcely be called permanent: even the death of a chief
causes them to be abandoned, and in a few months
long grass waves over the circlets of charred stakes and
straw.</p>

<p>The only sub-tribe of the Wak’hutu which deserves
notice is the Waziráhá, who inhabit the low grounds
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-123">[123]</span>
below the Mabruki Pass, in the first parallel of the Usagara
Mountains. They are remarkable only for having
beards somewhat better developed than in the other
Eastern races: in sickly appearance they resemble their
congeners.</p>

<p>Remain for consideration the Wadoe and the Wazegura.
The proper habitat of the Wadoe is between the
Watondwe or the tribes of Saadani, on the littoral, and
the Wak’hwere, near K’hutu, on the west; their northern
frontier is the land of the Wazegura, and their southern
the Gama and the Kingani Rivers. Their country, irrigated
by the waters of the Gama, is plentiful in grain,
though wanting in cattle; they export to Zanzibar sorghum
and maize, with a little of the chakazi or unripe
copal.</p>

<p>The Wadoe once formed a powerful tribe, and were
the terror of their neighbours. Their force was first
broken by the Wakamba, who, however, so weakened
themselves, that they were compelled to emigrate in
mass from the country, and have now fixed themselves
in a region about 14 marches to the north-west of Mombasah,
which appears to have been anciently called that
of the Meremongao. During this struggle the Wadoe
either began or, what is more likely, renewed a practice
which has made their name terrible even in African ears.
Fearing defeat from the Wakamba, they proceeded, in
presence of the foe, to roast and devour slices from the
bodies of the fallen. The manœuvre was successful; the
Wakamba could dare to die, but they could not face the
idea of becoming food. Presently, when the Wazegura
had armed themselves with muskets, and the people of
Whinde had organised their large plundering excursions,
the Wadoe lost all power. About ten years ago Juma
Mfumbi, the late Diwan of Saadani, exacted tribute
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-124">[124]</span>
from them, and after his death his sons succeeded to it.
In 1857, broken by a famine of long continuance, many
Wadoe fled to the south of the Kingani River, and obtained
from the Wazaramo lands near Sagesera and
Dege la Mhora.</p>

<p>The Wadoe differ greatly in colour and in form.
Some are tall, well-made, and light-complexioned Negroids,
others are almost black. Their distinctive mark&mdash;in
women as well as men&mdash;is a pair of long cuts down
both cheeks, from the temple to the jaw; they also frequently
chip away the two inner sides of the upper
central incisors, leaving a small chevron-shaped hole.
This however is practised almost throughout the country.
They are wild in appearance, and dress in softened skins,
stained yellow with the bark and flowers (?) of the mimosa.
Their arms are a large hide-shield, spears, bows,
and arrows, shokah or the little battle-axe, the sime-knife,
and the rungu or knobstick. They are said still
to drink out of human skulls, which are not polished or
prepared in any way for the purpose. The principal
chief is termed Mweme: his privy councillors are called
Mákungá (?), and the elders M’áná Miráo (?). The
great headmen are buried almost naked, but retaining
their bead-ornaments, sitting in a shallow pit, so that
the forefinger can project above the ground. With each
man are interred alive a male and a female slave, the
former holding a mundu or billhook wherewith to cut
fuel for his lord in the cold death-world, and the latter,
who is seated upon a little stool, supports his head in
her lap. This custom has been abolished by some of
the tribes: according to the Arabs, a dog is now buried
in lieu of the slaves. The subdivisions of the Wadoe
are numerous and unimportant.</p>

<p>The Wazegura, who do not inhabit this line of road,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-125">[125]</span>
require some allusion, in consequence of the conspicuous
part which they have played in the evil
drama of African life. They occupy the lands south
of the Pangani River to the Cape of Utondwe, and
they extend westward as far as the hills of Nguru.
Originally a peaceful tribe, they have been rendered
terrible by the possession of fire-arms; and their chiefs
have now collected large stores of gunpowder, used only
to kidnap and capture the weaker wretches within their
reach. They thus supply the market of Zanzibar with
slaves, and this practice is not of yesterday. About
twenty years ago the Wazegura serfs upon the island,
who had been cheaply bought during a famine for a few
measures of grain, rose against their Arab masters, retired
into the jungle, and, reinforced by malefactors and
malcontents, began a servile war, which raged with the
greatest fury for six months, when the governor, Ahmed
bin Sayf, maternal uncle to His Highness the late Sayyid
Said, brought in a body of mercenaries from Hazramaut,
and broke the force of this Jacquerie by setting a
price upon their heads, and by giving the captives as
prizes to the captors. The exploits of Kisabengo, the
Mzegura, have already been alluded to. The Arab merchants
of Unyanyembe declare that the road will never
be safe until that person’s head adorns a pole: they
speak with bitterness of heart, for he exacts an unconscionable
“blackmail.”</p>

<p>The Wazegura are in point of polity an exception to
the rule of East Africa: instead of owning hereditary
sultans, they obey the loudest tongue, the most open
hand, and the sharpest spear. This tends practically to
cause a perpetual blood-feud, and to raise up a number
of petty chiefs, who, aspiring to higher positions, must
distinguish themselves by bloodshed, and must acquire
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-126">[126]</span>
wealth in weapons, especially fire-arms, the great
title to superiority, by slave-dealing. The only occasion
when they combine is an opportunity of successful attack
upon some unguarded neighbour. Briefly, the
Wazegura have become an irreclaimable race, and such
they will remain until compelled to make a livelihood
by honest industry.</p>

<span class="chapname">HALT AT ZUNGOMERO, AND FORMATION OF THE CARAVAN.</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="noindent">I halted to collect carriage and to await the arrival
of the twenty-two promised porters for about a fortnight
at that hot-bed of pestilence, Zungomero, where we nearly
found “wet graves.” Our only lodging was under the
closed eaves of a hut built African-fashion, one abode
within the other. The roof was a sieve, the walls were
systems of chinks, and the floor was a sheet of mud.
Outside the rain poured pertinaciously, as if K’hutu had
been situated in the “black north” of Hibernia; the
periodical S. and S.W. winds were raw and chilling, the
gigantic vegetation was sopped to decay, and the tangled
bank of the Mgeta River, lying within pistol-shot of
our hovels, added its quotum of miasma. The hardships
of a march in inclement weather had taken effect
upon the Baloch guard: expecting everything to be
done for them they endured seven days of wet and
wind before they could find energy to build a shed, and
they became almost mutinous because left to make
shelter for themselves. They stole the poultry of the
villagers like gipsies, they quarrelled violently with the
slaves, they foully abused their temporal superior, Said
bin Salim, and three of the thirteen were accused of
grossly insulting the women of the Wak’hutu. The
latter charge, after due investigation, was “not proven:”
we had resolved, in case of its being brought home,
severely to flog the culprits or to turn them out of
camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-128">[128]</span></p>

<p>On the 27th July, Sayf bin Salim returned to Dut’humi
with his gang of thirty slaves, who also had distinguished
themselves by laying violent hands on sheep,
goats, and hens. Their patroon had offered to carry
our baggage half-way over the mountains to Ugogo, for
a sum of sixty dollars; thinking his conditions exorbitant,
I stipulated for conveyance the whole way.
He refused, declaring that he was about to organise
another journey up-country. I doubted his assertion,
as he was known to have audaciously defrauded Musa
Mzuri, an Indian merchant, who had entrusted him
with a large venture of ivory at Kazeh: yet he spoke
truth; nearly a year afterwards we met him on his
march to the “Sea of Ujiji.” During his visit he had
begged for drugs, tea, coffee, sugar, spices, everything,
but the stores were already far wasted by the improvidence
of the Goanese, who seemed to think that they
were living in the vicinity of a bazar. To punish me
for not engaging his gang, he caused the desertion of
nine porters hired at Dut’humi, by declaring that I was
bearing them into slavery. As they carried off, in
addition to half their pay, sundry sundries and Muinyi
Wazira’s sword, I sent three slave-musketeers to recover
the stolen goods per force if necessary. With respect
to the cloth, Sayf bin Salim wrote back to say that as I
could well afford the loss of a few “domestics,” he
would not compel the fugitives to restore it: at the
same time that he did himself the honour to return the
sword, which I might want. This man proved himself
the sole “base exception” to the hospitality and the
courteousness of the Omani Arabs. I forwarded an
official complaint to H. M. the Sayyid Majid, but the
arm of Zanzibar has not yet reached K’hutu.</p>

<p>At Zungomero five fresh porters were engaged,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-129">[129]</span>
making up the whole party to a total of 132 souls. They
were drafted into the men of Muinyi Wazira, whose open
indulgence in stingo had made his society at meals distasteful
to Moslem sticklers for propriety. He was an
able interpreter, speaking five African dialects, which is
not, however, in these lands a remarkable feat, and
when sober, he did at first the work of three men. But
linguists are a dangerous race, as the annals of old India
prove:&mdash;I doubt a bilingual Eastern man, and if he
can speak three languages I do not doubt him at all.
Moreover, true to his semi-servile breed&mdash;his dam
was a Mzaramo slave, and his sire a half-caste Wawahili&mdash;he
began well and he finished badly. His deep undying
fondness for pombe or holcus beer, kept him in
alternate states of maudlin apathy or of violent pugnacity.
He had incurred heavy debts upon the coast.
After his arrival at Unyamwezi, letters were sent urging
upon the Arabs his instant arrest, but fortunately for
him the bailiff and the jailor are not, as the venerable
saying declares the schoolmaster to be, abroad. Muinyi
Wazira, however, did not sight the Sea of Ujiji in my
service, and his five messmates, who each received 15
dollars’ worth of cloth for the journey thither and
back, were not more fortunate.</p>

<p>Before marching from Zungomero into the mountains
I will order, for the reader’s inspection, a muster of the
party, and enlist his sympathies in behalf of the unhappy
being who had to lead it.</p>

<p>Said bin Salim may pass on: he has been described
in Blackwood (February, 1858) and he scarcely deserves
a second notice. He is followed by his four slaves, including
the boy Faraj, who will presently desert, and
without including his acting wife, the lady Halimah. That
young person’s pug-dog countenance and bulky charms
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-130">[130]</span>
seem to engross every thought not appropriated to
himself. One day, however, my ears detect the loud
voice of wail proceeding from the lady Halimah, accompanying
methinks the vigorous performance of a
stick; the peccadillo was&mdash;but I eschew scandal and request
the lady to advance.</p>

<p>My companion’s gun carrier, Seedy Mubarak Bombay,
a negro from Uhiao, has twice been sketched in Blackwood
(March, 1858 and September, 1859), he also
requires no further celebrity. My henchman, Muinyi
Mabruki, had been selected by his fellow-tribeman
Bombay at Zanzibar; he was the slave of an Arab
Shaykh, who willingly let him for the sum of 5 dollars per
mensem. Mabruki is the type of the bull-headed negro,
low-browed, pig-eyed, pug-nosed, and provided by nature
with that breadth and power, that massiveness and muscularity
of jaw, which characterise the most voracious
carnivors. He is at once the ugliest and the vainest
of the party: his attention to his toilette knows no limit.
His temper is execrable, ever in extremes, now wild
with spirits, then dogged, depressed, and surly, then
fierce and violent. He is the most unhandy of men,
he spoils everything entrusted to him, and presently
he will be forbidden to engage in any pursuit
beyond ass-leading and tent-pitching. These worthies
commenced well. They excited our admiration by
braving noon-day suns, and by snoring heavily
through the rawest night with nothing to warm them
but a few smouldering embers. In an evil hour compassion-touched,
I threw over their shoulders a pair
of English blankets, which in the shortest time completely
demoralised them. They learned to lie a-bed o’
mornings, and when called up their shrugged shoulders
and shrinking forms were wrapped tightly round,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-131">[131]</span>
lest the breath of dawn should visit them too roughly.
Idleness marked them for her own: messmates and sworn
brothers; they made at the halt huts out of hail, lest
they should be called to do work. As a rule, however,
Englishmen have the art of spoiling Eastern servants:
we begin with the utmost stretch of exertion, and we
expect this high pressure system to last. Of course the
men’s energies are soon exhausted, their indolence and
apathy contrast with their former activity; we conceive
dislikes to them, and we end by dismissing them. This,
however, was not the case with Bombay and Mabruki.
They returned with us to Zanzibar, and we parted <i>à
l’aimable</i>, especially with the former, who, after a somewhat
protracted fit of the “blue devils,” became once
more, what he before had been, a rara avis in the lands,
an active servant and an honest man.</p>

<p>Regard for the Indian perusers of these pages, who
know by experience how “banal” a character is the half-caste
oriental Portuguese, prevents my offering anything
but a sketch of Valentine A. and Gaetano B.
I had hired them at Bombay for Co.’s rs. 20 per
mensem, besides board and lodging. Scions of that
half Pariah race which yearly issues from Goa, Daman
and Diu to gather rupees as “cook boys,” dry-nurses,
and “buttrels,” in wealthy British India, the
hybrids had their faults: a pride of caste, and a contempt
for Turks and heathen, heretics and infidels,
which often brought them to grief; a fondness for acting
triton amongst the minnows; a certain disregard for the
seventh commandment, in the matter of cloth and
clothes, medicines and provisions; a constitutional repugnance
to “Signior Sooth;” a wastefulness of other
men’s goods, and a peculiar tenacity of their own; a deficiency
of bodily strength and constitutional vigour; a
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-132">[132]</span>
voracity which induced indigestion once a day; and,
finally, a habit of frequent phlebotomy which, deferred,
made them sick. They had also their merits. Valentine
was a good specimen of the neat-handed and
ready-witted Indian: in the shortest time he learned to
talk Kisawahili sufficiently for his own purposes, and
to read a chronometer and thermometer sufficiently for
ours: he had, however, one blemish, an addiction to
“fudging,” which rendered the severest overseeing
necessary. A “Davy do a’ things,” he was as clever at
sewing a coat as at cooking a curry. Gaetano had a
curious kind of tenderness when acting nurse, and,
wonderful to relate, an utter disregard for danger: he
would return alone through a night-march of jungle to
fetch his forgotten keys, and would throw himself into
an excited mob of natives with a fearlessness which,
contrasted with his weakly body, never failed to turn
their wrath into merriment. He suffered severely from
the secondaries of fever, which, in his case, as in his
master’s, assumed a cerebral form. At Msene he was
seized with fits resembling epilepsy; and as he seemed
every month to become more addle-headed and scatter-brained,
more dirty and untidy, more wasteful and
forgetful, more loath to work without compulsion, and
more prone to start and feed the fire with ghee when
it was the scarcest of luxuries, I could not but attribute
many of his delinquencies to disease.</p>

<p>The Baloch are now to appear. My little party were
servants of His Highness the Sayyid Majid of Zanzibar,
who had detached them as an escort upon the usual
“deputation-allowance” of ten dollars per mensem.
They had received the command of their master to
accompany me wherever I might please to march, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-133">[133]</span>
they had been rendered responsible to him for the
safety of my person and property. As has been mentioned,
Lieut.-Col. Hamerton had advanced to them before
departure a small sum for outfit, and had promised
them, on condition of good conduct, an ample reward
on the part of H. M.’s Government after return to
Zanzibar. These men were armed with the usual matchlock,
the Cutch sabre,&mdash;one or two had Damascus
blades,&mdash;the Indian hide-targe, decorated with its usual
tinsel, the long khanjar or dagger, extra matches, flints
and steels, and toshdan, or ammunition pouches, sensibly
distributed about their persons.</p>

<p>The Jemadar Mallok led from Zanzibar seven warriors
of fame, yclept severally, Mohammed, Shahdad,
Ismail, Belok, Abdullah, Darwaysh, and the Seedy Jelai;
at Kaole he persuaded to follow his fortunes, Khudabakhsh,
Musa, Gul Mohammed, Riza, and Hudul a
tailor boy.</p>

<p>The Jemadar Mallok is a monocular, and the Sanscrit
proverb declares:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="verse indent00">“Rare a Kana (one-eyed man) is a good man and sound,<br /></span>
<span class="verse indent0">Rare a ladye gay will be faithful found.”<br /></span>
</div><!--stanza-->

</div><!--poetry-->
</div><!--poetry-container-->

<p class="noindent">Mallok is no exception to this rule of the “Kana.” He
is a man with fine Italian features, somewhat disfigured
by the small-pox: but his one eye never looks you
“in the face,” and there is an expression about the
mouth which forbids implicit trust in his honesty. He
proclaims himself to be somewhat fonder of fighting
than of feeding, yet suspicious circumstances led me to
believe that he was one of those whom the Arabs describe
as “first at the banquet and last at the brawl.”
He began with a display of zeal and activity which
died young; he lapsed, through grumbling and discontent,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-134">[134]</span>
into open insubordination as we progressed westward,
or from home; he became submissive and somewhat
servile as we returned to the coast, and when he took
leave of me he shed a flood of crocodile’s tears.</p>

<p>Mohammed is the Rish Safid, or greybeard of the
caravan, and without a greybeard no eastern caravan
considers itself <i>en règle</i>. Of these indispensable veterans
I had two specimens; but of what use they were,
except to teach hot youth the cold caution of eld, I
never could divine,&mdash;<i>vieux soldat, vielle bête</i>. In the civilised
regiment age is not venerable in the private, as every
grey hair is a proof that he has not merited or has forfeited
promotion; so in the East, where there is a paucity
of competitors in the race of fortune, the Rish Safid
of humble fortune may be safely set down as a fool or a
foolish knave, and though his escort is sought, he generally
proves himself to be no better than he should have
been.</p>

<p>Mohammed’s body is apparently hard as a rock, his
mind is soft as putty, and his comrades, disappointed in
their hopes of finding brains behind those wrinkles,
derisively compare him to a rotten walnut, and say
before his face, “What! grey hairs and no wits?” He
has invested the fifteen dollars advanced to him as outfit
by Lieut.-Col. Hamerton, in a slave-boy, whom presently
he will exchange for a slave-girl, despite all the
inuendoes of his friends. He was at first a manner of
peace-maker, but soon my refusal to enlist and pay
his slave as a hired porter acted like Ithuriel’s spear.
This veteran of fractious temper and miserly habits
ended, in a question of stinted rations, by drawing his
sabre upon and cutting at his Jemadar; an offence
which I was compelled to visit with a bastinado, inflicted
out of the sight of man by the hand of Khudabakhsh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-135">[135]</span></p>

<p>Shahdad is the Chelebi of the party, the fast young
man. He is decidedly not handsome. A figure short
and <i>trapu</i>, a retrussed nose, small pigs’ eyes, a beard
like a blackberry bush, and a crop of hair which, projecting
its wiry waves in a deep long curtain from beneath
a diminutive scarlet fez, makes his head appear
top-heavy. Yet he does sad havoc amongst female
hearts by means of his zeze or guitar, half a gourd with
an arm to which is attached a single string, and by his
lively accompaniment is a squeaking falsetto, which is
here as fascinating and emollient to the sex as ever
was the organ of Rubini in Europe. During a lengthened
sojourn at Bombay he has enlarged his mind by the
acquisition of the Hindostani tongue and of Indian
trickery. He is almost the only Eastern whom I remember
that abused the poor letter H like a thoroughbred
Londoner. His familiarity with Anglo-Europeans,
and his experience touching the facility of gulling them,
has induced in him a certain proclivity for peculation,
grumbling, and mutiny. His brother&mdash;or rather cousin,
for in these lands all fellow-tribesmen are brethren&mdash;“Ismail”
is a confirmed invalid, a man with a “broken
mouth,” deeply sunken cheeks, and emaciated frame,
who, though earnestly solicited to return eastwards,
will persist in accompanying the party till he falls a
victim to a chronic malady in Unyamwezi.</p>

<p>Belok is our snob; a youth of servile origin, with
coarse features, wide mouth, everted lips, and a pert, or
rather an impudent expression of countenance, which,
acting as index to his troublesome character, at once
prejudices the physiognomist against him. Belok’s
comrades have reason to quote the Arab saw, “Defend
me from the beggar become wealthy, and from the slave
become a freeman!” He has invested his advance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-136">[136]</span>
salary in a youth; and the latter serves and works for
the rest of the mess, who must patiently and passively
endure the insolence of the master for fear of losing the
offices of the man. After the fashion of a certain sort
of fools, he applies the whole of his modicum of wit to
mischief-making, and he succeeds admirably where
better men, whose thoughts attempt a wider range,
would fail. By his exertions the Baloch became, in
point of social intercourse, not unlike the passengers of
a ship bound on a long voyage: after the first month
the society divides itself into two separate and adverse
cliques; after the second it breaks up into little knots;
and after the third it is a chequer-work of pairs and
solitaires. Arrived at the “Pond of Ugogo,” I was
compelled to address an official letter to Zanzibar, requesting
the recal of Belok and his coadjutor in mischief,
Khudabakhsh.</p>

<p>Abdullah is the type of the respectable, in fact, of
the good young man. It is really pathetic to hear him
recount, with accents broken by emotion, the “tale full
of waters of the eye,”&mdash;the parting of an only son, who
was led away to an African grave, from the aged widow
his mamma; to listen to her excellent advice, and to his
no less excellent resolves. He is capable of calling his
bride elect, were such article a subject ever to be mentioned
amongst Moslems, “his choicest blessing.” With
an edifying mingling of piety and discipline, he never
neglects the opportunity of standing in prayer behind
the Jemadar Mallok, whose elevation to a superior
grade&mdash;<i>honneur oblige!</i>&mdash;has compelled him to rub up
a superficial acquaintance with the forms of devotion.
Virtue in the abstract I revere; in the concrete I sometimes
suspect. The good young man soon justified this
suspicion by repeatedly applying to Said bin Salim for
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-137">[137]</span>
beads, in my name, which he converted to his own
purposes.</p>

<p>Of Darwaysh little need be said. He is a youth
about twenty-two years old, with a bulging brow, a
pair of ferret-eyes, a “peaky” nose, a thin chin; in
fact, with a face the quintessence of curiosity. He
is the “brother”&mdash;that is to say, the spy&mdash;of the
Jemadar, and his principal peculiarity is a repugnance
to obeying an order because it is an order. With
this individual I had at first many a passage of words.
Presently prostrated in body and mind by severe disease,
he obtained relief from European drugs; and from
that time until the end of the journey, he conducted
himself with a certain stiffness and decorum which contrasted
pleasantly enough with the exceeding “bounce”
of his earlier career.</p>

<p>The Seedy Jelai calls himself a Baloch, though palpably
the veriest descendant of Ham. He resents with
asperity the name of “Nigger,” or “Nig”&mdash;Jupiter
Tonans has heard of the offensive dissyllable, which was
a household word before the days of the Indian mutiny,
but has he heard of the more offensive monosyllable
which was forced upon the abbreviating Anglo-Saxon
by the fatal necessity of requiring to repeat the word
so frequently? Jelai clothes his long lank legs&mdash;cucumber-shinned
and bony-kneed&mdash;in calico tights,
which display the full deformity of those members; and
taking a pride in the length of his mustachios, which
distinguishes him from his African-born brethren, he
twists them <i>en croc</i> like a hidalgo in the days of Gil
Blas. The Seedy, judging from analogy, ought to be
brave, but he is not. On the occasion of alarm in the
mountains of Usagara, he privily proposed to his comrades
to “bolt” and leave us. Moreover, on the “Sea
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-138">[138]</span>
of Ujiji,” where he was chosen as an escort, he ignobly
deserted me.</p>

<p>Khudabakhsh was formed by nature to be the best
man of the party; he has transformed himself into the
worst. A man of broad and stalwart frame, with stern
countenance, and a quietness of demeanour which
usually argues <i>sang-froid</i> and persistency, his presence
is in all points soldier-like and prepossessing. But his
temper is unmanageable: he enters into a quarrel when
certain of discomfiture; he is utterly reckless,&mdash;on one
occasion he amused himself by blowing a charge of
gunpowder into the calves of African warriors who
were dancing in front of him;&mdash;and lastly, his innate
propensity for backbiting, intrigue, and opposition to
all authority, render him a dangerous member of the
Expedition. He herds with Belok, whose tastes lie in
the same line: he is the head and front of all mischief,
and presently his presence will become insupportable.</p>

<p>Musa, a tall, gaunt, and dark-brown old man, is the
assistant Rish Safid, or greybeard; in fact, the complement
of “Greybeard Mohammed.” After a residence
of twenty years at Mombasah, he has clean forgotten
Persian; he speaks only a debased Mekrani dialect, and
the Kisawahili, which, as usual with his tribe, he prefers.
An old soldier, he compensates for want of youth and
vigour by artfulness; an old traveller&mdash;nothing better
distinguishes in these lands the veteran of the road
from the griffin or greenhorn, than the careful and
systematic consideration of his comforts&mdash;he carries
the lightest matchlock, he starts in the cool of the
morning, he presses forward to secure the best quarters,
and throughout he thinks only of himself. His character
has a want of wrath, which, despite his white
hairs, causes him to be little regarded. Greybeard
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-139">[139]</span>
Mohammed is considered a fool; Greybeard Musa, an
old woman. Yet he troubles himself little about the
opinions of his fellows, he looks well after his morning
and evening meals, his ghee, his pipe, and his sleeping
mat; and knowing that he will last out all the novices,
with enviable philosophy he casts ambition to the
winds.</p>

<p>Gul Mohammed is the most civilised man of the
party. He has straight and handsome features, of the
old Grecian type, a reddish-brown skin&mdash;the skin by
excellence&mdash;and a Central-Asian beard of largest dimensions.
His mind is as civilised as his body; he is an
adept after the fashion of his tribe, in divinity especially,
in medicine and natural history; and when landing
at Marka, he actually took the trouble to visit, for
curiosity, the Juba River. Unfortunately, “Gul Mohammed”
is a mixture of Baloch mountaineer-blood with
the Sindhian of the plain, and the cross is, throughout
the East, renowned for representing the worst points of
both progenitors. Gul Mohammed is brave and treacherous,
fair-spoken and detractive, honourable and dishonest,
good-tempered and bad-hearted.</p>

<p>Of the Baloch remain Riza, and Hudul, the tailor-boy:
the former is a kind of Darwaysh, utterly insignificant,
but by no means so disagreeable as his fellows:
the only marking corporeal peculiarity of the latter is
a deficiency of skin; his mouth appears ever open, and
his teeth resemble those of an old rabbit. His mental
organisation has its <i>petite pointe</i>, its little twist; he is
under the constant delusion that those who speak in
unknown tongues are employed specially in abusing
him. His first complaint was against the Goanese: as
he could not understand a word of their language, it
was dismissed with some derision; he then charged me
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-140">[140]</span>
to his comrades with his normal grievance, and in due
time he felt aggrieved by my companion.</p>

<p>A proper regard to precedence induces me now to
marshal the “sons of Ramji,” who acted as interpreters,
guides, and war-men. They were armed with the old
“Tower-musket,” which, loaded with nearly an ounce
of powder, they never allowed to quit the hand; and
with those antiquated German-cavalry sabres which
find their way over all the East: their accoutrements
were small leathern boxes, strapped to the waist,
and huge cow-horns, for ammunition. The most part
called themselves Muinyi (master), the title of an African
freeman, because they had been received in pawn by the
Banyan Ramji from their parents or uncles, who had
forgotten to redeem the pledge, and they still claimed the
honour of noble birth. Of these there were eight men
under their Mtu Mku, or chief man, Kidogo&mdash;Anglicè,
Mr. Little. Kidogo had preceded the Expedition, escorting
the detachment of thirty-six Wanyamwezi
porters to Zungomero, and he possessed great influence
over his brother slaves, who all seemed to admire and
to be proud of him. He was by no means a common
man. “Natione magis quam ratione barbarus;” he had
a fixed and obstinate determination: amongst these
puerile, futile African souls he was exceptional as “a
sage Sciote or a green horse.” His point of honour
consisted in the resolve that his words should be held
as Median laws, and he had, as the Africans say, a
“large head,” namely, abundant self-esteem, that
blessed quality which makes man independent of his
fellows. Muinyi Kidogo is a short, thin, coal-black
person, with a something arguing gentle blood in his
tribe, the Wadoe Cannibals; he has a peaked beard, a
bulging brow, close thin lips, a peculiar wall-eyed
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-141">[141]</span>
roll of glance, and a look fixed, when unobserved,
with a manner of fascination which men felt. His
attitude is always humble and deprecatory, he drops
his chin upon the collar of reflection, he rarely speaks,
save in dulcet tones, low, plaintive, and modulated; yet
agreeing in every conceivable particular, he never fails
to introduce a most pertinacious “but,” which brings
him back precisely to his own starting-point. The
vehemence of his manner, and the violence of his
temper, win for him the fears of the porters; having
a wife and children in Unyamwezi, he knows well the
languages, the manners, and the customs of the people;
he never hesitates, when necessary, to enforce his mild
commands by a merciless application of the staff, or to
air his blade and to fly at the recusant like a wild cat.
In such moods, he is always seized by his friends, and
led forcibly away, as if dangerous. To insure some
regularity on the road, I ordered him to meet Said bin
Salim and Muinyi Wazira every evening at my tent,
for a “Mashauri,” or palaver, about the next day’s march
and halt. The measure was rendered futile by Kidogo,
who soon contrived so to browbeat the others, that
they would not venture an opinion in his presence. As
a chief, he would have been in the right position; as a
slave, he was falsely placed, because determined not to
obey. He lost no time in demanding that he and his
brethren should be considered Askári, soldiers, whose sole
duty it was to carry a gun; and he took the first opportunity
of declaring that his men should not be under the
direction of the Jemadar. Having received for answer
that we could not all be Sultans, he retired with a
“Ngema”&mdash;a “very well,” accompanied by a glance that
boded little good. From that hour the “sons of Ramji”
went wrong. Before, servilely civil, they waxed insolent;
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-142">[142]</span>
they learned their power&mdash;without them I must
have returned to the coast&mdash;and they presumed upon it.
They assumed the “swashing and martial outside” of
valiant men: they disdained to be “mechanical;” they
swore not to carry burdens; they objected to loading
and leading the asses; they would not bring up articles
left behind in the camp or on the road; they claimed the
sole right of buying provisions; they arrogated to themselves
supreme command over the porters; and they
pilfered from the loads whenever they wanted the
luxuries of meat and beer; they drank deep; and on
more than one occasion they endangered the caravan
by their cavalier proceedings with the fair sex. It was
“water-painting” to complain; they had one short
reply to all objections, namely, the threat of desertion.
Preferring anything to risking the success of the Expedition,
I was reduced to the bitter alternative of long-suffering,
but it was with the hope of a <i>revanche</i> at
some future time. The suffering was perhaps not
wholly patient. Orientals advise the traveller “to
keep his manliness in his pocket for braving it and
ruffling at home.” Such, however, is not exactly the
principle or the practice of an Englishman, who recognises
a primary duty of commanding respect for himself,
for his successors, and for the noble name of his
nation. On the return of the Expedition, Kidogo
proved himself a “serviceable villain,” but an extortionate;
anything committed to him was, as the Arabs
say, in “ape’s custody,” and the only remedy was to
remove him from all power over the outfit.</p>

<p>Under the great Kidogo were the Muinyi Mboni,
Buyuni, Hayja, and Jako; these four took precedence
as being the sons of Diwans, whilst the commonalty was
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-143">[143]</span>
represented by the Muinyi Shehe, Mbaruko, Wulaydi,
and Khamisi.</p>

<p>The donkey-men, five in number, had been hired at
the rate of thirty dollars per head for the whole time of
exploration. Their names were Musangesi, Sangora,
Nasibu, Hasani, and Saramalla. Of their natures little
need be said, except that they were a trifle less manageable
than the “sons of Ramji:” perfect models of servile
humanity, obstinate as asses and vicious as mules,
gluttonous and lazy, noisy and overbearing, insolent
and quarrelsome as slaves.</p>

<p>Lowest in rank, and little above the asses even in their
own estimation, are the thirty-six Wanyamwezi Pagazi,
or porters, who formed the transport-corps. Concerning
these men and their burdens, a few words of explanation
will be necessary.</p>

<p>In collecting a caravan the first step is to “make,”
as the people say, a “Khambi,” or kraal. The Mtongi,
or proprietor of the goods, announces, by pitching his
tent in the open, and by planting his flag, that he is
ready to travel; this is done because amongst the
Wanyamwezi a porter who persuades others to enlist
does it under pain of prosecution and fine-paying if a
death or an accident ensue. Petty chiefs, however,
and their kinsmen will bring with them in hope of promotion
a number of recruits, sometimes all the male
adults of a village, who then recognise them as headmen.
The next step is to choose a Kirangozi or guide.
Guides are not a peculiar class; any individual of influence
and local knowledge who has travelled the road before is
eligible to the post. The Kirangozi must pay his followers
to acknowledge his supremacy, and his Mganga
or medicine-man for providing him with charms and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-144">[144]</span>
prophylactics. On the march he precedes his porters,
and any one who breaks this rule is liable to a fine.
He often undergoes abuse for losing the way, for
marching too far or not far enough, for not halting at
the proper place, and for not setting out at the right
time. In return he enjoys the empty circumstance of
command, and the solid advantage of better food and a
present, which, however, is optional, at the end of the
journey: he carries a lighter load, and his emoluments
frequently enable him to be attended by a slave. The
only way of breaking the perverse and headstrong herd
into a semblance of discipline, is to support the Kirangozi
at all conjunctures, and to make him, if possible,
dole out the daily rations and portion the occasional
presents of meat.</p>

<p>At the preliminary Khambi the Mtongi superintends
the distribution of each Muzigo or load. The Pagazi
or porters are mostly lads, lank and light, with the lean
and clean legs of leopards. Sometimes, however, a
herculean form is found with the bullet-head, the broad
bull-like neck, the deep wide chest, and the large strong
extremities that characterise the Hammal of Stamboul.
There is usually a sprinkling of greybeards, who might
be expected, as the proverb is, to be “leaning against
the wall.” Amongst these races, however, the older
men, who have learned to husband their strength, fare
better than their juniors, and the Africans, like the
Arabs, object to a party which does not contain
veterans in beard, age, and experience. In portioning
the loads there is always much trouble: each individual
has his favourite fancy, and must choose, or, at any
rate, must consent to his burden. To load porters
properly is a work of skill. They will accept at the
hand of a man who knows their nature a weight which,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-145">[145]</span>
if proposed by a stranger, would be rejected with grunts
of disgust. They hate the inconvenience of boxes,
unless light enough to be carried at both ends of a
“Banghi”-pole by one man, or heavy enough to be
slung between two porters. The burden must never
be under a fair standard, especially when of that description
that it decreases by expenditure towards the
end of the journey; a lightly-laden man not only becomes
lazy, he also makes his fellows discontented. The
nature of the load, however, causes an inequality of
weight. Cloth is tightly rolled up in the form of a
huge bolster, five feet long by eighteen to twenty-four
inches in diameter, protected against wear and weather
by Makanda or coarse matting of brab-leaf, and corded
over. This bundle is fastened, for the purpose of preserving
its shape and for convenience of stacking, in a
cradle of three or more flexible branches, cut from a
small tree below the place of junction, barked and
trimmed, laid along the length of the load, and
confined at the open end by a lashing of fibre-rope.
Besides his weapons and marching kit, a man will carry
a pack of two Frasilah or seventy pounds, and this
perhaps is the maximum. Beads are placed in long,
narrow bags of domestics, matted, corded, and cradled in
sticks like cloth; being a less elastic load, they are more
difficult to carry, and therefore seldom exceed fifty
pounds. Brass, and other wires, are carried in daur,
khata, or circles, lashed to both ends of a pole, which is
generally the large midrib of a palm-frond, with a fork
cut in its depth at one extremity to form a base for the
load when stacked, and provided at the point of junction
with a Kitambara or pad of grass, rag, or leather.
Wire is the lightest, as ivory is the heaviest, of loads.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-146">[146]</span>
The African porter will carry only the smallest burdens
upon his head, and the custom is mostly confined to
women and children. The merchants of course carry
nothing but themselves, except in extreme cases; but
when the sudden sickness or the evasion of a porter
endangers the safety of his load, they shoulder it without
hesitation. The chief proprietor usually follows
his caravan, accompanied by some of his partners and
armed slaves, to prevent the straggling which may
lead to heavy loss; he therefore often endures the
heat and tedium of the road longer than the rest of his
party.</p>

<p>The loads of the Pagazi, it has appeared, are composed
of beads, cloth, and wire, which in this land of “round
trade” or barter, supply the wants of a circulating
medium, and they severally represent copper, silver,
and gold. For a detailed notice, the reader is referred
to the appendix; in this place a few general remarks
will suffice to set before him the somewhat complicated
use of the articles.</p>

<p>Of beads there are about 400 varieties, some of which
have each three or four different names. The cheapest,
which form the staple of commerce, are the Hafizi,
Khanyera or Ushanga Waupe, a round white porcelain,
the price of which averages at Zanzibar 1 dollar per
5 or 6 lbs. avoirdupois. The most expensive are the
Samsam or Samesame, also called Joho (scarlet cloth),
Kimara-p’hamba (food-finishers), because a man will
part with his dinner to obtain them, and Kifunjyá-mji
(town-breakers), because the women will ruin themselves
and their husbands for them: these are the small coral-bead,
scarlet enamelled upon a white ground, they are of
fifteen different sizes, and the value at Zanzibar is from
13 to 16 dollars per 35 lbs. Beads are purchased from
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-147">[147]</span>
the Banyan monopolisers unstrung, and are afterwards
mounted by the merchant upon T’hembe, or threads of
palm-fibre; much depends for success in sale upon the
regularity and the attractiveness of the line. The
principal divisions are the bitil and the khete, which
may represent the farthing and the penny. The former
is a single length from the tip of the index to the wrist;
the latter, which comprises four of the former, is a
double length round the thumb to the elbow-bone, or what
is much the same, twice the circumference of the throat.
Ten khete compose the fundo or knot, which is used
in the larger purchases, and of these from two to three
were daily expended in our small expenses by the
Goanese servants, whilst the usual compensation for
rations to an African is a single khete. The utmost
economy should be exercised in beads: apparently exhaustless
a large store goes but a little way, and a man’s
load rarely outlasts a month. It is difficult to divine
what becomes of these ornaments: for centuries ton after
ton has been imported into the country, they are by no
means perishable substances, and the people carry, like
the Indians, their wealth upon their persons. Yet not
a third of the population was observed to wear any considerable
quantity; possibly the excessive demand in
the lands outlying direct intercourse with the coast,
tends to disperse them throughout the vast terra incognita
of the central African basin.</p>

<p>The African preserves the instincts of infancy in the
higher races. He astonished the enlightened De Gama
some centuries ago by rejecting with disdain jewels, gold,
and silver, whilst he caught greedily at beads and other
baubles, as a child snatches at a new plaything. To the
present day he is the same. There is something painfully
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-148">[148]</span>
ludicrous in the expression of countenance, the intense
and all-absorbing admiration, and the greedy
wistfulness with which he contemplates the rubbish.
Yet he uses it as a toy: after sacrificing perhaps his
goat or his grain to become the happy possessor of a
khete, he will hang it round his neck for a few days,
and then, child-like, weary of the acquisition, he will do
his best to exchange it for another. In all bargains
beads must be thrown in, especially where women are
concerned: their sisters of civilisation would reproach
themselves with an unconscious lapse into the “nil admirari”
doctrines so hateful to the muscular system of
the age, and with a cold indifference to the charms of diamonds
and pearls, could they but witness the effect of a
string of scarlet porcelains upon the high-born dames in
Central Africa.</p>

<p>The cloths imported into East Africa are of three
kinds, Merkani, Kaniki, and “cloths with names.”</p>

<p>“Merkani,” in which we detect the African corruption
of American, is the article “domestics”&mdash;unbleached
shirting and sheeting from the mills near Salem. Kaniki,
is the common Indian indigo dyed cotton. “Cloths
with names,” as they are called by the Africans, are
Arab and Indian checks, and coloured goods, of cotton
or silk mixed with cotton. Of these the most common
is the Barsati, a dark blue cotton cloth with a broad
red stripe, which representing the dollar in the interior
is useful as presents to chiefs. Of double value is the
Dabwani, made at Maskat, a small blue and white check,
with a quarter breadth of red stripe, crossed with white
and yellow: this showy article is invariably demanded
by the more powerful Sultans for themselves and their
wives, whilst they divide the Merkani and Kaniki,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-149">[149]</span>
which composes their Honga&mdash;“blackmail” or dash&mdash;amongst
their followers.</p>

<p>The people of East Africa, when first visited by the
Arabs, were satisfied with the coarsest and flimsiest
Kaniki imported by the Banyans from Cutch. When
American merchants settled at Zanzibar, Kaniki yielded
before the advance of “Merkani,” which now supplies
the markets from Abyssinia to the Mozambique. But
the wild men are fast losing their predilection for a
stuff which is neither comfortable nor durable, and in
many regions the tribes satisfied with goat-skins and
tree barks, prefer to invest their capital in the more attractive
beads and wire. It would evidently be advantageous
if England or her colonies could manufacture
an article better suited to the wants of the country than
that now in general use; but as long as the Indian
short-stapled cotton must be used, there is little probability
of her competing with the produce of the New
World.</p>

<p>In Eastern Africa cotton cloth is used only for wear.
The popular article is a piece of varying breadth but
always of four cubits, or six feet, in length: the braça of
Portuguese Africa, it is called by the Arabs, shukkah,
by the Wasawahili, unguo, and in the far interior
upande or lupande. It is used as a loin-wrapper, and is
probably the first costume of Eastern Africa and of
Arabia. The plate borrowed from Montfaucon’s edition
of the “Topographia Christiana,” by Dr. Vincent (Part
I. Appendix to the Periplus) shows the Shukkah, to be
the general dress of Ethiopians, as it was of the Egyptians,
and the spear their weapon. The use of the Shukkah
during the Meccan pilgrimage, when the devotees cast
off such innovations as coats and breeches for the national
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-150">[150]</span>
garb of their ancestors, proves its antiquity
throughout the regions eastward of the Red Sea. On
the African coast the Shukkah Merkani is worth about
0·25 dollars = 1<i>s.</i> 0<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub><i>d.</i>, in the interior it rises to the
equivalent of a dollar (4<i>s.</i> <i>2d.</i>) and even higher. The
Kaniki is but little cheaper than the Merkani, when
purchased upon the sea-board; its increase of value in
the interior, however, is by no means in proportion to
its prime cost, and by some tribes it is wholly rejected.
A double length of Shukkah, or twelve feet, the article
worn by women who can afford it, is called a Doti, and
corresponds with the Tobe of Abyssinia and of the
Somali country. The whole piece of Merkani, which
contains from seven to eleven Doti, is termed a Jurah
or Gorah.</p>

<p>After beads and piece-goods, the principal imports into
Eastern Africa, especially on the northern lines and in
the western portion of the great central route, are
Masango or brass wires of large sizes, Nos. 4 and 5.
They are purchased at Zanzibar, when cheap, at 12,
and when dear at 16, dollars per Frasilah of 35 lbs.
When imported up-country the Frasilah is divided
into three or four large coils, called by the Arabs
“daur,” and by the Africans “khata:” the object is
convenience of attachment to the porters’ banghy-poles.
Arrived at Unyanyembe they are converted by artisans
into the kitindi, or coil-bracelet, a peculiarly African
decoration. It is a system of concentric circles extending
from the wrist to the elbow; at both extremities it
is made to bulge out for grace and for allowing the
joints to play; and the elasticity of the wire keeps it in
its place. It weighs nearly 3 lbs., yet&mdash;“vanity knows
no sore”&mdash;the women of some tribes will wear four of
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-151">[151]</span>
these bulky decorations upon their arms and legs. It
is mostly a feminine ornament. In the Lake Regions,
however, men assume the full-sized armlet, and in the
mountains of Usagara their wrists, arms, and ankles
are often decorated with half and quarter lengths, which
being without terminal bulges, appear to compress the
limbs painfully. At Unyanyembe the value of a
kitindi varies from two to four shukkah; at Ujiji,
where the ornament is in demand it rises to four or
five.</p>

<p>The remainder of the live stock forming the <i>personnel</i>
of the caravan is composed of asses. At Zanzibar I
had bought five riding animals to mount the chiefs of the
party, including Said bin Salim and the Goanese. The
price varied from fifteen to forty dollars. Of the twenty-nine
asses used for carriage, only twenty remained
when the muster was made at Zungomero, and the rapid
thinning of their numbers by loss, death and accident
began to suggest uncomfortable ideas.</p>

<p>The following “Equipment of the Expedition,” sent
by me to Mr. Francis Galton, the South African traveller,
and bearing date, “Camp Zungomero in Khutu,
Sunday, 2nd August, 1857,” is here republished: it
will assist the reader in picturing to himself the mass
of material which I am about to drag over the mountains.</p>

<p><i>Provisions, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;1 dozen brandy (to be followed by
4 dozen more); 1 box cigars; 5 boxes tea (each 6
lbs.); a little coffee; 2 bottles curry stuff, besides
ginger, rock and common salt, red and black pepper, one
bottle each, pickles, soap, and spices; 20 lbs. pressed
vegetables; 1 bottle vinegar; 2 bottles oil; 20 lbs.
sugar (honey is procurable in the country).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-152">[152]</span></p>

<p><i>Arms and Ammunition</i>, including 2 smooth bores, 3
rifles, a Colt’s carbine, and 3 revolvers, spare fittings,
&amp;c., and 3 swords. Each gun has its leather bag
with three compartments, for powder-flask, ball, caps,
patches, &amp;c. 100 lbs. gunpowder (in 2 safety copper
magazines and others); 60 lbs. shot; 380 lbs. lead
bullets, cast of hardened material at the Arsenal, Bombay,
placed in boxes 40 lbs. each for convenience of
carriage, also to serve as specimen boxes, and screwed
down to prevent pilfering; 20,000 copper caps; wadding.</p>

<p>The Baloch are armed with matchlocks, shields,
swords, daggers and knives. They have for ammunition&mdash;40
lbs. gunpowder (4 kegs); 1000 lead bullets;
1000 flints for slaves’ muskets, and are to be followed by
about an equal quantity of ammunition.</p>

<p><i>Camp Furniture.</i>&mdash;1 sepoy’s rowtie; 1 small (gable-shaped)
tent of two sails joined, to cover and shelter
property in this land of perpetual rains; 1 table and
chair; 1 tin Crimean canteen, with knives and forks,
kettle, cooking-pots, &amp;c.; bedding, painted tarpaulin cover,
2 large cotton pillows for stuffing birds, 1 air pillow, 2
waterproof blankets (most useful), 1 Maltese blanket
(remarkably good), and 2 other blankets; 1 cork bed,
with 2 pillows, 3 blankets, and mosquito net. The
Goanese have thick cotton padded mattresses, pillows,
and blankets, and all the servants have some kind of bedding.
3 solid leather portmanteaus for clothes and
books; 1 box, like an Indian petarah, for books; 1
patent leather bag for books, washing materials, diaries,
drawing-books, &amp;c.; 1 small couriers’ bag, for instruments,
&amp;c.; 5 canvas bags for kit generally; 3 mats,
used as carpets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-153">[153]</span></p>

<p><i>Instruments.</i>&mdash;1 lever watch; 2 chronometers; 2
prismatic compasses, slings, and stands; 1 ship’s azimuth
compass; 2 pocket compasses; 1 pocket thermometer;
1 portable sun-dial; 1 rain gauge; 1 evaporating
dish; 2 sextants and boxes, with canvas bags
to be slung over porters’ shoulders; 2 artificial horizons
(with a little extra mercury, to be followed by more);
1 pocket lens; 1 mountain barometer lent by Bombay
Geographical Society (very delicate); 3 thermometers;
1 measuring tape (100 ft.); 1 sounding lead; 2 boiling
thermometers; 1 box of mathematical instruments;
1 glass; 1 telescope; 2 ft. rule with brass slide; 1
pocket pedometer by Dixie; 1 parallel ruler.</p>

<p><i>Stationery.</i>&mdash;Foolscap paper; 1 ream common paper;
6 blank books; 3 Letts’ diaries; 2 dozen pencils; 6
pieces caoutchouc; 6 metallic note books; 3 memorandum
ditto; 1 box wafers and sealing wax; 2 field
books; steel pens; quill ditto; ink powder which makes
up well without acid; 3 bottles ink; 1 bottle native
ink; 2 sets meteorological tables, blank; 4 tin cylinders
for papers (very bad, everything rusts in them);
Nautical Almanacs for 1857 and 1858; charts, Mr.
Cooley’s maps; “Mombas mission map”; skeleton maps;
table of stars; account book; portfolio; wooden and tin
cylinders for pens, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Tools.</i>&mdash;1 large turnscrew; 1 hand saw; 1 hammer;
20 lbs. nails; 1 hand vice; 1 hone; 9 hatchets (as a
rule every porter carries an axe); 2 files; 9 Jembe or
native hoe; 9 Mas’ha or native dibbles; 1 cold chisel;
1 heavy hammer; 1 pair pincers. To be followed by
1 bench vice; 1 hand ditto; 12 gimlets of sizes; 1
18-inch stone grinder, with spindle and handle; 6 splitting
axes; 12 augers of sizes; 2 sets centre-bits, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-154">[154]</span>
stock; 12 chisels; 4 mortise chisels; 2 sets drills; 24
saw files; 6 files of sorts; 4 gouges of sizes; 50 lbs.
iron nails; 2 planes, with 2 spare irons; 3 hand saws;
screws. These things were expected to be useful at the
lakes, where carpenters are in demand.</p>

<p><i>Clothing, Bedding, and Shoes.</i>&mdash;Shirts, flannel and
cotton; turbans and thick felt caps for the head. (N.B.
not looking forward to so long a journey, we left Zanzibar
without a new outfit; consequently we were in tatters
before the end, and in a climate where flannel fights half
the battle of life against death, my companion was compelled
to invest himself in overalls of American domestics,
and I was forced to cut up blankets into coats
and wrappers. The Goanese also had laden themselves
with rags which would have been refused by a Jew;
they required to be re-clothed in Kaniki, or blue
cotton. African travel is no favourable opportunity for
wearing out old clothes; the thorny jungles, and the
practice of packing up clothes wet render a double outfit
necessary for long journeys. The second should be
carried packed up in tin&mdash;flannel-shirts, trousers and
stocks, at least six of each,&mdash;not to be opened till required.</p>

<p>The best bedding in this country would be a small
horsehair mattrass with two blankets, one thick the
other thin, and mosquito curtains that would pack into
the pillow. A simple carpet-bag without leathern or
other adjuncts, should contain the travelling clothes,
and all the bedding should roll up into a single bundle,
covered with a piece of waterproof canvass, and tightly
bound with stout straps.</p>

<p>As regards shoes, the best would be ammunition
boots for walking and jack boots for riding. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-155">[155]</span>
must be of light colour, and at least one size too large
in England; they should be carefully protected from
external air which is ruinous to leather, and they must
be greased from time to time,&mdash;with fat not with oil&mdash;otherwise
they will soon become so hard and dry, that
it is impossible to draw them on unless treated after the
Indian plan, viz. dipped in hot water and stretched
with a stuffing of straw.)</p>

<p>Life at Zungomero I have said was the acme of discomfort.
The weather was, as usual at the base of the
mountains, execrable; pelting showers descended in a
succession, interrupted only by an occasional burst of fiery
sunshine which extracted steam from the thick covert
of grass, bush, and tree. The party dispersing throughout
the surrounding villages, in which it was said about
1000 travellers were delayed by the inundations, drank
beer, smoked bhang, quarrelled amongst themselves, and
by their insolence and violence caused continual complaints
on the part of the villagers. Both the Goanese
being prostrated with mild modifications of “yellow
jack,” I was obliged to admit them into the hut, which
was already sufficiently populated with pigeons, rats, and
flies by day, and with mosquitos, bugs, and fleas, by
night. At length weary of waiting the arrival of the
twenty-two promised porters, we prepared our papers,
which I committed to the confidential slave of a coast
Diwan, here dwelling as caravan-touter, for his uncle
Ukwere of Kaole. His name was somewhat peculiar,
Chomwi la Mtu Mku Wambele, or the “Headman Great
Man of Precedence;”&mdash;these little Jugurthas have all
the titles of emperors, with the actual power of country
squires;&mdash;he never allowed himself to appear in public
sober, and to judge from the list of stations with which
he obliged me&mdash;of eighteen not one was correct&mdash;I hesitated
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-157">[157]</span>
to entrust his slave with reports and specimens.
But the Headman Great Man of Precedence did as he
promised to do, and as his charge arrived safely, I here
make to him the “amende honorable.”</p>

<p class="noindent">On the 7th August, 1857, the Expedition left Zungomero.
We were martyred by miasma; my companion and I
were so feeble, that we could scarcely sit our asses, and
weakness had almost deprived us of the sense of hearing.
It was a day of severe toil. We loaded with
difficulty, for the slaves and porters did not assemble
till past 8 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>, and instead of applying for their loads
to Said bin Salim, every man ran off with the lightest
burden or the easiest ass.</p>

<div class="container" id="Illoi-5">

<p class="caption">THE EAST AFRICAN GHAUTS.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-159">[159]</span></p>

<p>From Central Zungomero to the nearest ascent of the
Usagara Mountains is a march of five hours. The route,
emerging from the cultivated districts, leaves to the
right the Wigo Hills, so called, probably, from the fishing
weirs in the stagnant waters below, and in the
Mgeta River, which flows through the plain. On the
left, and distant four or five miles, is a straggling line
of low cones: at the foot of one, somewhat larger than
its neighbours, rises the thermal spring known to the
people as the Maji ya W’heta, the Geyser, jetting-water,
or <i>fontaine qui bouille</i>. Its position is a gentle slope
between the hill-base and a dwarf Savannah which is
surrounded by high walls of jungly forest, and the water-shed
is from south to north. The hot water boils and
bubbles out of a white sand, here and there stained and
encrusted with oxide of iron. Upon the surface lie
caked and scaly sheets of calcareous tufa, expressed by
the spring, and around it are erratic boulders blackened
probably by the thermal fumes. The earth is dark,
sometimes sandy, and sprinkled over with fragments of
quartzite and sandstone; in other places a screen of brab-tree
backs a bold expanse of ground, treacherous, boggy,
and unstable as water. The area is about 200 feet in
diameter, and the centre of ebullition is unapproachable,
owing to the heat and the instability of the soil. According
to the guides, it is subject to occasional eruptions,
when the water bursts out with violence, and
fragments of lime are flung high in the air. Animals
are said to refuse it, and tales are told of wild beasts
having been bogged in the seething mire.</p>

<p>With the Mgeta thrown on the left hand, we passed
by a path almost invisible, through dense grass and
trees, and presently we entered the luxuriant cultivation
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-160">[160]</span>
surrounding the westernmost villages of K’hutu.
As the land beyond this point, for three long marches,
lies barren, the slaves and porters had comfortably
housed themselves. The prospect of another night in
the plains made me desperate; I dislodged them, and
persuaded them to advance once more. The settlements
were of the most miserable description; many
were composed of a few sticks lashed together at the top,
and loosely covered with a few armfuls of holcus-cane.
Here we sighted the cocoa-tree for the last time. The
rats were busy in the fields, and the plundered peasants
were digging them out for food. At almost every
corner of the deeply-pitted path stood a mtego, or trap
for small birds, a cage of rush or split bamboo planted
in the ground near some corn, where a boy lies waiting
till the prey nibbles at the bait, and then creeping up, bars
with his hand the little doorway left in one of the sides.
Beyond the villages the path forded six times the sandy
bed of the Mgeta, whose steep and slippery banks supported
dense screens of shrub and grass. Beyond the
sixth passage, the road falls into the gravelly river-shoals,
with the stream flowing in the other half of the
course, under well-wooded masses of primitive hill.
After again thrice fording the cold and muddy water,
which even in the dry season is here ankle, there foot-deep,
the road passed some clearings where porcupines
and the African red squirrel, a sturdy little animal,
with a long thick fur of dark brown, shot with green
on the back, and a bright red waistcoat, muzzle, and
points, were observed. About noon we diverged a few
yards from the Mgeta, and ascended the incline of the
first gradient in Usagara, rising about 300 feet from
the plain below. This, the frontier of the second region,
or ghauts, and the debris encumbering the lowest
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-161">[161]</span>
escarpment, is called Mzizi Mdogo, or the “Little Tamarind,”
to distinguish it from the “Great Tamarind”
station which lies beyond. There was no vestige of
building upon the spot&mdash;no sight nor sound of man&mdash;the
blood-feud and the infernal slave-trade had made a
howling desert of the land. We found, however, a
tattered kraal erected by the last passing caravan, and,
spent with fatigue, we threw ourselves on the short grass
to rest. The porters and the asses did not appear till
the evening, when it became apparent that two of the
latter had been lost by their drivers, Hayja and Khamisi,
sons of Ramji, who preferred sitting in the
shade, and chatting with passing caravans, to the sore
task of doing their duty. The animals were recovered
on the morrow, by sundry parties sent in search. During
the fordings of the Mgeta, however, they had not been unpacked;
our salt and sugar, therefore, had melted away;
soap, cigars, mustard, and arsenical paste, were in pulp;
the tea was spoiled, the compressed vegetables presently
became musty, and the gunpowder in a fire-proof copper
magazine was caked like stale bread.</p>

<p>There was a wondrous change of climate at Mzizi
Mdogo; strength and health returned as if by magic;
even the Goanese shook off the obstinate bilious remittents
of Zungomero. Truly delicious was the escape
from the nebulous skies, the fog-driving gusts, the pelting
rain, the clammy mists veiling a gross growth of
fetor, the damp raw cold, rising as it were from the
earth, and the alternations of fiery and oppressive
heat; in fact, from the cruel climate of the river-valley,
to the pure sweet mountain-air, alternately soft and
balmy, cool and reviving, and to the aspect of clear
blue skies, which lent their tints to highland ridges
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-162">[162]</span>
well wooded with various greens. Dull mangrove, dismal
jungle, and monotonous grass, were supplanted by
tall solitary trees, amongst which the lofty tamarind
rose conspicuously graceful, and a card-table-like
swamp, cut by a network of streams, nullahs, and stagnant
pools, gave way to dry healthy slopes, with short
steep pitches, and gently shelving hills. The beams of
the large sun of the equator&mdash;and nowhere have I seen
the rulers of night and day so large&mdash;danced gaily upon
blocks and pebbles of red, yellow, and dazzling snowy
quartz, and the bright sea-breeze waved the summits
of the trees, from which depended graceful llianas, and
wood-apples large as melons, whilst creepers, like vine
tendrils, rising from large bulbs of brown-grey wood,
clung closely to their stalwart trunks. Monkeys played at
hide-and-seek, chattering behind the bolls, as the iguana,
with its painted scale-armour, issued forth to bask upon
the sunny bank; white-breasted ravens cawed when disturbed
from their perching-places; doves cooed on the
well-clothed boughs, and hawks soared high in the transparent
sky. The field-cricket chirped like the Italian
cigala in the shady bush, and everywhere, from air,
from earth, from the hill slopes above, and from the
marshes below, the hum, the buzz, and the loud continuous
voice of insect life, through the length of the
day, spoke out its natural joy. Our gipsy encampment
lay</p>

<p>By night, the soothing murmurs of the stream at the
hill’s base rose mingled with the faint rustling of the
breeze, which at times broken by the scream of the night-heron,
the bellow of the bull-frog in his swampy home, the
cynhyæna’s whimper, and the fox’s whining bark, sounded
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-163">[163]</span>
through the silence most musical, most melancholy. Instead
of the cold night rain, and the soughing of the blast,
the view disclosed a peaceful scene, the moonbeams lying
like sheets of snow upon the ruddy highlands, and the
stars hanging like lamps of gold from the dome of infinite
blue. I never wearied with contemplating the
scene, for, contrasting with the splendours around me,
still stretched in sight the Slough of Despond, unhappy
Zungomero, lead-coloured above, mud-coloured below,
wind-swept, fog-veiled, and deluged by clouds that
dared not approach these Delectable Mountains.</p>

<p>During a day’s halt at this sanitarium fresh diversions
agitated the party. The Baloch, weary of worrying one
another, began to try their ’prentice hands upon the
sons of Ramji, and these fortified by the sturdy attitude
of Muinyi Kidogo, manfully resolved to hold their own.
The asses fought throughout the livelong night, and,
contrary to the custom of their genus, strayed from one
another by day. And as,</p>

<p class="noindent">Said bin Salim, who hated and was hated by the Baloch,
on account of their divided interests, began to hate
and to be hated by the sons of Ramji. His four
children, the most ignoble of their ignoble race, were
to him as the apples of his eyes. He had entered
their names as public porters, yet, with characteristic
egotism and self-tenderness, he was resolved that they
should work for none but their master, and that even in
this their labour should as much as possible fall upon
the shoulders of others. His tent was always the first
pitched and his fire the first built; his slaves were rewarded
with such luxuries as ghee, honey, and turmeric,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-164">[164]</span>
when no one in camp, ourselves included, could procure
them. When all wanted clothes he clad his children
out of the outfit as if it had been his own, and, till
strong remonstrances were made, large necklaces of
beads decked their sooty necks. On the return-march
he preferred to pay hire for three porters rather than to
allow the fat lazy knaves to carry a bed or a few gourds.
They became of course insolent and unmanageable&mdash;more
than once they gave trouble by pointing their muskets
at the Baloch and the porters, and they would draw
their knives and stab at a man who refused to give up his
firewood or his hearth-stones, without incurring a word of
blame from their master. Encouraged by impunity they
robbed us impudently; curry-stuff was soon exhausted,
the salt-bottles showed great gaps, and cigar-ends were
occasionally seen upon the road-side. The Goanese accused
the slaves, and the slaves the Goanese; probably
both parties for once spoke the truth.</p>

<p>Said bin Salim’s silly favouritism naturally aroused
the haughty Kidogo’s bile; the sons of Ramji, consequently,
worked less than before. The two worthies,
Arab and African, never, however, quarrelled, no harsh
word passed between them; with smiles upon their faces,
and a bitter hate at heart, they confined themselves to all
manner of backbiting and talebearing. Said bin Salim
sternly declared to me that he would never rest satisfied
until Kidogo’s sword was broken and his back was scarified
at the flagstaff of Zanzibar; but I guessed that
this “wrathful mouse and most magnanimous dove”
would, long before his journey’s end, have forgotten all
his vengeance. Kidogo asserted that the Muarabu or
Arab was a green-horn, and frequently suggested the
propriety of “planting” him. At last this continual harping
upon the same chord became so offensive, that B’ana
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-165">[165]</span>
Saidi was forbidden to pronounce the name of Muinyi
Kidogo, and Muinyi Kidogo was ordered never to utter
the words B’ana Saidi before the exasperated leader of
the Expedition, who could not, like these squabblers, complain,
resent, forget and forgive, in the short space of a
single hour.</p>

<p>We left Mzizi Mdogo on the 9th August, much
cheered by the well-omened appearance of a bird with
red bill, white breast, and long tail-feathers. The path
ran over a succession of short steep hills with a rufous-brown
soil, dotted with blocks and stones, thinly veiled
with grass, and already displaying signs of aridity in
the growth of aloetic and thorny plants, the Cactus and
the larger Asclepias, the Euphorbia or Spurge-wort, and
the stunted Mimosa. The Calabash, however, still rose
a stately tree, and there was a sprinkling of the fine
Tamarinds which have lent their name to the district.
The Tamarind, called by the Arabs of Zanzibar
“Subar,” extends from the coast to the Lake Regions:
with its lofty stem, its feathery leaflets, and its branches
spreading dark cool shade, it is a beautiful feature in
African landscape. The acidulated fruit is doubtless a
palliative and a corrective to bilious affections. The
people of the country merely peel and press it into bark
baskets, consequently it soon becomes viscid, and is
spoiled by mildew; they ignore the art of extracting
from it an intoxicating liquor. The Arabs, who use
it extensively in cooking, steam, sun-dry, and knead
it, with a little salt and oil to prevent the effects of
damp, into balls: thus prepared and preserved from the
air, it will keep for years.</p>

<p>On the way we were saddened by the sight of the
clean-picked skeletons, and here and there the swollen
corpses, of porters who had perished in this place of
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-166">[166]</span>
starvation. A single large body which had lost fifty of
its number by small-pox, had passed us but yesterday on
the road, and the sight of their deceased comrades recalled
to our minds terrible spectacles; men staggering on
blinded by disease, and mothers carrying on their backs
infants as loathsome objects as themselves. The wretches
would not leave the path, every step in their state of
failing strength was precious; he who once fell would
never rise again; no village would admit death into its
precincts, no relation nor friend would return for them,
and they would lie till their agony was ended by the
raven and vulture, the Fisi and the fox. Near every
Khambi or Kraal I remarked detached tents which,
according to the guides, were set apart for those seized
with the fell disease. Under these circumstances, as
might be expected, several of our party caught the infection;
they lagged behind and probably threw themselves
into some jungle, for the path when revisited
showed no signs of them.</p>

<p>We spent 4 hrs. 30′ in weary marching, occasionally
halting to reload the asses that threw their
packs. Near the Mgeta River, which was again
forded six times, the vegetation became tall and thick,
grasses obstructed the path, and in the dense jungle on
the banks of the stream, the Cowhage (<i>Dolichos pruriens</i>,)
and stiff reeds known as the “wild sugar-cane,” annoyed
the half-naked porters. Thus bounded and approached
by muddy and slippery, or by steep and stony
inclines, the stream shrank to a mountain torrent, in
places hardly fifty feet broad; the flow was swift, the
waters were dyed by the soil a ruddy brown, and the
bed was sandy and sometimes rocky with boulders of
primitive formation, streaked with lines of snow-white
quartz. Near the end of the marsh we ascended a short
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-167">[167]</span>
steep staircase of rock and root, with a dwarf precipice
overhanging the river on the right, which was dangerous
for the laden beasts as they crawled like beetles up the
path. At 3 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> we arrived at a kraal called Cha
K’henge&mdash;of the iguana, from the number of these animals
found near the stream. It was a delightful spot,
equal to Mzizi Mdogo in purity of air, and commanding
a fair prospect of the now distant Dut’humi Highlands.</p>

<p>The next day was a forced halt at Cha K’henge. Of
two asses that had been left behind one was recovered,
the other was abandoned to its fate. The animals purchased
at Zanzibar were falling off visibly in condition.
Accustomed to a kind of grass which nowhere grows
upon these sunburnt hills, they had regular feeds of
holcus, but that, as Said bin Salim expressed himself, was
only coffee to them. The Wanyamwezi asses, however,
managed to pick a sustenance from the rushes and from
the half-burned stubbles, when fortunate enough to find
any. Sickness again declared itself. Shahdad the
Baloch bellowed like a bull with fever pains, Gaetano complained
that he was suffering tortures generally, two of
the Wanyamwezi were incapacitated by the symptoms
preliminary to small-pox from carrying their packs,
and a third was prostrated by ague. We started, however,
on the next day for a long march which concluded,
the passage of the “Tamarind Hills.” Crossing a
country broken by dry nullahs, or rather ditches, we
traversed a seam of forest with a deep woody ravine on
the right, and twice unpacked and reloaded the asses,
who lay down instead of breasting the difficulties: a
muddy swamp full of water-courses, and the high earth-banks
of the Rufuta a Fiumara, here dry during the
hot season. Thence, winding along a hill-flank, to avoid
a bend in the bed, the path plunged into the sole of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-168">[168]</span>
Rufuta. This main-drain of the lower gradients carries
off, according to the guides, the waters of the high
ground around it into the Mgeta. The bed, which
varies from three to sixteen feet in breadth, serpentines
abruptly through the hills: its surface is either deep
sand or clay, sopped with water, which near the head
becomes a thin fillet, ankle-deep, now sweet, then salt: the
mud is tinged in places with a solution of iron, showing,
when stagnant, prismatic and iridescent tints. Where
narrowest, the tall grasses of the banks meet across the
gut, which, after a few yards of short, sharp winding,
opens out again. The walls are in some parts earth, in
others blocks of gray syenite, which here and there encumber
the bed: on the right, near the end of the stage,
the hills above seem to overhang the Fuimara in almost
perpendicular masses of sandstone, from whose chinks
spring the gnarled roots of tall trees corded with creepers,
overgrown with parasites; and hung with fruits like footballs,
dangling from twines sometimes thirty feet long.
The lower banks, where not choked with rush, are overgrown
with the brightest verdure, and with the feathery
bamboo rising and falling before the wind. The corpses
of porters were even more numerous than on the yester:
our Muslems passed them with averted faces and with
the low “la haul!” of disgust, and a decrepid old
Mnyamwezi porter gazed at them and wept for himself.
About 2 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, turning abruptly from the bed, we crawled
up a short stony steep strewed with our asses and their
loads; and reaching the summit of a dwarf cone near
the foot of the “Goma Pass,” we found the usual outlying
huts for porters dying of small-pox, and an old
kraal, which we made comfortable for the night. In the
extensive prospect around, the little beehive villages of
the Wakaguru and the Wakwivi, sub-tribes of the Wasagara,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-169">[169]</span>
peeped from afar out of the forest nooks on the
distant hill-folds. The people are rich in flocks and
grain, but a sad experience has taught them to shun
intercourse with all strangers, Arabs and Wasawahili,
Wamrima and Wanyamwezi. In happier days the road
was lined with large villages, of which now not a trace
remains.</p>

<p>A Boiling Point Thermometer by Cox, the gift of
Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, and left with him by Captain,
now Admiral Smyth, F. R. G. S., who had used it in measuring
the Andes, had been accidentally broken by my
companion at Cha K’henge. Arrived at Rufuta, I found
that a second B. P. by Newman, and a Bath-Thermometer
by the same maker, had been torn so violently
from their box that even the well-soldered handles were
wrenched off. But a few days afterwards our third
B. P. was rendered useless by the carelessness of Gaetano.
Thus, of the only three really accurate hypsometrical
instruments which we possessed,&mdash;the Barometer
had come to grief, and no aneroid had been sent
from Bombay&mdash;not one was spared to reach the Lake.
We saved, however, two Bath-Thermometers marked
Newman, and Johnson and Co., Bombay, which did good
service, and one of which was afterwards corrected by
being boiled at sea-level. I may here observe that on
such journeys, where triangulation is impossible, and
where the delicate aneroid and the Mountain Barometer
can scarcely be carried without accident, the thermometer
is at present the traveller’s stand-by. It abounds, however,
in elements of error. The elasticity of the glass,
especially in a new instrument, causes the mercury to
subside below the graduated scale. The difference of
level in a covered “shaving-pot” and in an open pan
exposed to the wind, will sometimes amount to 1° F. =
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-170">[170]</span>
500 feet: they therefore are in error who declare that
any vessel suffices for the purpose of boiling. Finally,
in all but the best instruments the air is not thoroughly
expelled from the tube: indeed some writers,
Dr. Buist, for instance, actually advise the error.</p>

<p>Another ass was left at Rufuta unable to stand, and
anxiously eyeing its stomach, whereby the Baloch conjectured
that it was dying of a poisonous grass. Having
to ascend on the 12th August the Goma Pass of the
Rufuta, or the Eastern Range, I had arranged with
Kidogo and the Kirangozi, or guide, that the porters
should proceed with their packs, and after topping the
hill, should return, for a consideration, to assist the asses.
None, however, reappearing, when the sun had risen a
spear’s length we set out, hugging the hill-flanks, with
deep ravines yawning on the right. Presently after passing
through a clear forest of tall scattered trees, between
whose trunks were visible on both sides in perspective,
far below, long rolling tracts of well-wooded land broken
by ravines and cut by water-courses, we arrived at the
foot of a steep hill. The ascent was a kind of ramp,
composed of earth-steps, clods bound by strong tenacious
roots, and thickly strewn with blocks of schiste,
micacious grit, and a sandstone showing the presence
of iron. The summit of this “kloof” was ascertained
to rise 2,235 feet above sea-level. It led to an easy
descent along the flank of a hill commanding on the
left hand, below a precipitous foreground, a fine bird’s-eye
view of scattered cone and wavy ridge rising and
falling in a long roll, and on a scale decreasing till they
settled into a line of hazy-blue horizon, which had all
the effect of a circumambient ocean. We reached
the remains of a kraal on the summit of a dwarf hill
called Mfu’uni, from the abundance of the Mfu’u tree,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-171">[171]</span>
which bears an edible apple externally like the smallest
“crab,” but containing a stone of inordinate proportions:
below the encamping ground the Pagazi found
a runnel of pure water, which derived its name from
the station. In former times Mfu’uni was a populous
settlement; the kidnapping parties from the coast, and
especially the filibusters of Whinde, have restored it to
the fox and the cynhyæna, its “old inhabitants.” I
spent a sleepless night in watching each star as it sank
and set in its turn, piercing with a last twinkle the thin
silhouette of tall trees that fringed the hilly rim of the
horizon, and in admiring the hardness of the bull-headed
Mabruki, as he lay half-roasted by the fire and
half-frozen by the cold southern gale.</p>

<p>Rations had been issued at K’hutu to all hands for
three days, the time in which they expected to make the
principal provisioning-place, “Muhama.” They had
consumed, as usual, their stores with the utmost possible
quickness; it was our fifth day, and Muhama was still
a long march distant. On the 13th August, therefore,
in that hot haste which promises cold speed, we loaded
at dawn, and ascended the last step of the pass by an
easy path. The summit was thickly wooded; the hills
were crowned with trees; the ravines were a mass of
tangled verdure; and from the Dub (<i>Cynodon dactylon</i>, a
nutritive and favourite food for cattle in India) and other
grasses arose a sickening odour of decay. A Scotch mist,
thick and raw, hung over the hill-tops, and about 10 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>
a fiery outburst of sunshine told severely upon hungry
and fever-stricken men. From the level table-summit of
the range the route descended rapidly at first, but presently
stretching out into gentle slopes, totally unlike
the abrupt eastern or seaward face of the mountains: I
counted twelve distinct rises and fifteen falls, separated
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-172">[172]</span>
by tree-clad lines of half-dried nullahs, which were
choked with ill-savoured weeds. We halted every
quarter of an hour to raise and reload the asses;
when on the ground, they were invariably abandoned
by the donkey-men. My companion’s bedding was
found near the path, where it had been left by its
porter, a slave given at Zungomero to Muinyi Wazira
by his drunken brother. The fellow had been sworn
by his mganga, or medicine-man, not to desert, and
he had respected his oath for the long length of a week.
A dispute with another man, however, had irritated
him: he quietly threw his burden, and ran down the
nearest steep, probably to fall into the hands of the Wakwivi.
As the rain-catching peaks were left behind, the
slopes of dry soil began to show sunburnt herbage and
tufty grass. Signs of lions appeared numerous, and
the cactaceous and aloetic plants that live on arid soil
again met the eye. About noon we forded the little
Zonhwe River, a stream of sweet water here flowing
westward, in a bed of mire and grass, under high banks
bearing a dense bush. Two hours afterwards I suddenly
came upon the advance-guard, halted, and the
asses unloaded, in a dry water-course, called in the map,
from our misadventure, “Overshot Nullah.” A caravan
of Wanyamwezi had misdirected them, Muinyi Wazira
had in vain warned them of their error, he was overruled
by Kidogo, and the Baloch had insisted upon
camping at the first place where they expected to find a
spring. Like all soft men, they were most impatient of
thirst, and nothing caused so much grumbling and discontent
as the cry of “Maji mb’hali!” (water is far!)
That night, therefore, after a long march of fifteen miles,
they again slept supperless.</p>

<p>On the 14th of August we loaded early, and through
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-173">[173]</span>
spitting rains from the south-east hills we marched back
for two hours from the Overshot Nullah to Zonhwe, the
small and newly-built settlement which we had missed
on the preceding day. Several of the porters had disappeared
during the night. Men were sent in all directions
for provisions, which came in, however, slowly and
scantily; and the noise made by the slaves&mdash;they
were pulling down Said bin Salim’s hut, which had
accidentally caught fire&mdash;frightened away the country-people.
We were, therefore, detained in this unwholesome
spot for two days.</p>

<p>Zonhwe was the turning-point of the Expedition’s
difficulties. Another ass had died, reducing the number
to twenty-three, and the Baloch, at first contented with
two, doubled their requirements, and on the 14th August
took a fifth, besides placing all their powder
upon our hard-worked animals. I therefore proposed to
the Jemadar that the cloth, the beads, and the other
similar luggage of his men, should be packed, sealed up,
and inserted into the porters’ loads, of which several had
shrunk to half-weight. He probably thought the suggestion
a ruse on my part to discover the means by which
their property had almost trebled its quantity; his men,
moreover, had become thoroughly weary of a journey
where provisions were not always obtainable, and they
had persuaded themselves that Lieut.-Col. Hamerton’s
decease had left me without support from the government
of Zanzibar. After a priming with opium, the monocular
returned and reported that his men refused to
open their baggage, declaring their property to be “on
their own heads.” Whilst I was explaining the object
of the measure, the escort appeared in mass, and, with
noise sufficient for a general action, ostentatiously
strewed their old clothes upon the ground, declaring
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-174">[174]</span>
that at Zanzibar they were honourable men, and boasting
that the Baloch were entrusted with lacs of dollars by
the Sayyid Said. Again I offered reasons, which, as is
the wont of the world in such cases, served only to make
them more hopelessly unreasonable. The Jemadar accused
me of starving the party. I told him not to eat
abominations, upon which, clapping hand to hilt, he
theatrically forbade me to repeat the words. Being
prostrated at the time by fever, I could only show him
how little dangerous he was by using the same phrase
half a dozen times. He then turned fiercely upon the
timid Said bin Salim, and having safely vented the excess
of his wrath, he departed to hold a colloquy with his men.</p>

<p>The debate was purposely conducted in so loud a tone
that every word reached my ears. Khudabakhsh, from
first to last my evil genius and the mainspring of all
mischief, threatened to take “that man’s life,” at the
risk of chains for the remainder of his days. Another
opined, that “in all Nazarenes there is no good.” All
complained that they had no “hishmat” (respect!), no
food, and, above everything, no meat.</p>

<p>Presently Said bin Salim was deputed by them to
state that for the future they would require one sheep
per diem&mdash;men who, when at Zanzibar, saw flesh probably
once a year on the Eed. This being inadmissible,
they demanded three cloths daily instead of one. I
would willingly have given them two, as long as provisions
continued scarce and dear, but the shade of concession
made them raise the number to four. They
declared that in case of refusal they would sleep at the
village, and on the next day would return to Zanzibar.
Receiving a contemptuous answer, they marched away in
a body, noisily declaring that they were going to make
instant preparation for departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-175">[175]</span></p>

<p>Such a proceeding on the part of several of these
mercenaries was inexcusable. They had been treated
with kindness, and even indulgence. They had hitherto
never complained, simply because they had no cause for
complaint. One man, Ismail, who suffered from dysentery,
had been regularly supplied with food cooked
by the Goanese; and even while we dragged along our
fevered frames on foot, he was allowed to ride an ass.
Yet the recreant never attempted a word of dissuasion,
and deserted with the rest.</p>

<p>After the disappearance of the Baloch, the Sons of
Ramji were summoned. I had privily ascertained
from Said bin Salim the opinions of these men concerning
their leader: they said but little evil, complaining
principally of the Englishman’s “heat,” and that he was
not wholly ruled by their rascalities, whereas the Baloch
in their private confabs never failed to indulge in the
choicest of Oriental Billingsgate. The slaves, when
they heard the state of the case, cheerfully promised to
stand by us, but on the same evening, assembled by
Kidogo, they agreed to follow the example of the escort
on the first justifiable occasion. I did not learn this till
some days afterwards, and even if I had been told it on
the spot, it would have mattered little. My companion
and I had made up our minds, in case of the escort and
the slaves deserting, to bury our baggage, and to trust
ourselves in the hands of the Wanyamwezi porters. The
storm, however,&mdash;a <i>brutum fulmen</i>&mdash;blew over with
only noise.</p>

<p>A march was ordered for the next day&mdash;the 17th
August. As the asses were being loaded, appeared the
one-eyed Jemadar, with Greybeard Musa and Darwaysh,
looking more crestfallen and foolish than they had ever
looked before. They took my hand with a polite
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-176">[176]</span>
violence, begged suppliantly for a paper of dismissal to
“cover their shame,” and declared that, so far from deserting
me, I was deserting them. As this required no
reply, I mounted and rode on.</p>

<p>The path fell easily westwards down a long grassy
and jungly incline, cut by several water-courses. About
noon, I lay down half-fainting in the sandy bed of the
Muhama Nullah&mdash;the “Palmetto,” or “Fan-palm;” and
retaining Wazira and Mabruki, I urged the caravan
forwards, that my companion might send me back a
hammock from the halting-place. Suddenly appeared
the whole body of deserters shouldering&mdash;as porters and
asses had been taken from them&mdash;their luggage, which
outwardly consisted of cloth, dirty rags, green skins, old
earthen pots, and greasy gourds and calabashes. They
led me to a part of the nullah where stagnant water
was found, and showing abundant penitence, they ever
and anon attempted excuses, which were reserved for
consideration. At 3 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, no hammock appearing, I
remounted, and pursued a path over rolling ground,
with masses of dwarf-hill flanking a low bottom, which
renewed the scenery of the “Slough of Despond”&mdash;Zungomero.
Again the land, matted with putrid grass,
displayed the calabash and the hyphæna, the papaw
and the palmetto; the holcus and maize were of luxuriant
dimensions, and deep rat-holes, enlarged by the
boy-hunters, broke the grassy path. I found two little
villages, inhabitated by Wangindo and Mandandu immigrants
from the vicinity of Kilwa. Then appeared on
a hill-side the Kraal in which the caravan had halted;
the party had lost the road, and had been dispersed by a
swarm of wild bees, an accident even more frequent in
East Africa than in India.</p>

<p>Next morning the Baloch were harangued; they professed
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-177">[177]</span>
themselves profoundly penitent, and attributing
their unsoldier-like conduct to opium, and to the Wiswas,
the temptations of Sathanas, they promised to reform.
The promise was kept till we reached Ugogi. They
were, however, always an encumbrance; they did no
good beyond creating an impression, and “making the
careless Æthiopians afraid.” I saw them, it is true, in
their worst colours. They held themselves to be servants
of their prince, and as no Eastern man can or will
serve two masters, they forfeited all claim to their
sole good quality&mdash;manageability. As men, they had no
stamina; after a few severe marches they murmured that</p>

<p class="noindent">Their constitutions, sapped by long residence at Zanzibar,
were subject to many ailments, and in sickness they were
softer than Indian Pariahs. Under the slightest attack
of fever, they threw themselves moaning upon the ground;
they were soon deterred by the sun from bringing up
the rear, and by night they would not keep watch or
ward even when in actual danger of robbery. Notwithstanding
their affectation of military carriage their
bravery was more than problematical; they were disciplined
only by their fears. As men at arms, one and
all deserved to wear the wooden spoon: I saw the whole
garrison of Kaole firing for an hour, without effect, at a
shell, stuck on a stick, distant about a dozen paces:
our party expended thirty pounds of gunpowder without
bagging a pair of antelope, and it was impossible to
trust them with ammunition; when unable to sell it,
they wasted it upon small birds. Ever claiming for
themselves “hishmat,” or respect, they forgot their own
proverb that “courtesy hath two heads;” they complained
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-178">[178]</span>
that they were not seated half the day in our tents, and
the being “told to depart,” when their terribly long
visits rendered the measure necessary, was a standing
grievance. Like the lower races of Orientals, they
were ever attempting to intrude, to thrust themselves
forwards, to take an ell when an inch was offered; they
considered all but themselves fools, ready to be imposed
upon by the flimsiest lie, by the shallowest artifices.
Gratitude they ignored; with them a favour granted was
but an earnest of favours to come, and one refusal obliterated
the trace of a hundred largesses. Their objects
in life seemed to be eating, and buying slaves; their
pleasures, drinking and intrigue. Insatiable beggars
were they; noisy, boisterous, foul-mouthed knaves,
swearers “with voices like cannons;” rude and forward
in manner, low and abusive in language, so slanderous
that for want of other subjects they would calumniate
one another, and requiring a periodical check to their
presumption. I might have spent the whole of my day
in superintending the food of these thirteen “great
eaters and little runners.” Repeatedly warned, both by
myself and by my companion, that their insubordination
would prevent our recommending them for recompense
at the end of the journey, they could not check repeated
ebullitions of temper. Before arrival at the coast they
seemed to have made up their minds that they had not
fulfilled the conditions of reward. After my departure
from Zanzibar, however, they persuaded Lieut.-Col.
Hamerton’s successor to report officially to the Government
of Bombay “the claims of these men, the hardships
they endured, and the fidelity and perseverance
they showed!”</p>

<p>At Muhama I halted three days, a delay which generally
occurred before long desert marches for which
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-179">[179]</span>
provisions are required. On the first, Kidogo would bring
about sixty pounds of grain; on the second, he would
disperse his men throughout the villages, and procure the
300 pounds required for five marches; and on the third,
he would cause it to be husked and pounded, so as to be
ready for the morrow. Three up-caravans, containing a
total of about 150 men, suffering severely from small-pox,
here passed us. One was commanded by Khalfan bin
Muallim Salim and his brother Id, coast Arabs, whom
we afterwards met at two places. He told me several
deliberate falsehoods about the twenty-two porters
that were to follow us, for instance, that he had left
them, halted by disease, at Kidunda, in the maritime
region, under the command of one Abdullah bin
Jumah, and thus he led me to expect them at a time
when they had not even been engaged. He and his men
also spread reports in Ugogo and other places where
the people are peculiarly suspicious concerning the
magical and malignant powers of the “whites;” in fact,
he showed all the bad spirit of his bastard blood. At
Muhama, the furthest point westward to which the
vuli or autumnal rains extend, the climate was still
that of the Rufuta Range, foggy, misty mornings, white
rags of cloudbank from the table-cloths outspread upon
the heights, clear days, with hot suns and chilling south
winds, and raw dewy nights. I again suffered from fever;
the attack, after lasting seven days, disappeared, leaving,
however, hepatic complications, which having lasted uninterruptedly
ten months, either wore themselves out,
or yielded to the action of acids, narcotics, and stimulants
tardily forwarded from Zanzibar. Here also over-fatigue,
in a fruitless shooting-excursion, combined with
the mephitic air of stagnant, weedy waters, caused a
return of my companion’s fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-180">[180]</span></p>

<p>Two other Wanyamwezi porters were laid up with
small-pox. One ass died of fatigue, whilst a second
torn by a hyæna, and a third too weak to walk, were left,
together with the animal that had been stung by bees, in
charge of Mpambe, headman of the Wangindo. Being
now reduced to the number of nineteen beasts, I submitted
to Said bin Salim the advisability of leaving
behind wire and ammunition, either cached in the jungle,
as is the custom of these lands, or entrusted to the
headman. The Arab approved; Kidogo, however, dissented.
I took the opinion of the latter, he was positive
that the effects once abandoned would never be recovered,
and that the headman, who appeared a kind of
cunning idiot, was not to be trusted. Some months
afterwards I commissioned an Arab merchant, who was
marching towards the coast, to recover the asses left in
the charge of Mpambe; the latter refused to give them
up, thus proving the soundness of Kidogo’s judgment.</p>

<p>Having collected with difficulty&mdash;the land was sun-cracked,
and the harvest-store had been concealed by
the people&mdash;some supplies, but scarcely sufficient for
the long desert tract, we began, on the 21st of August,
to cross the longitudinal plain that gently shelving westward
separates the Rufuta from the second, or Mukondokwa
Range. The plain was enclosed on all sides
by low lines of distant hill, and cut by deep nullahs,
which gave more than the usual amount of trouble.
The tall Palmyra (<i>Borassus Flabelliformis</i>), whose majestic
bulging column renders it so difficult to climb,
was a novel feature in the scenery. This tree, the
Mvumo of East Africa, and the Deleb-palm of the
Upper Nile, is scattered through the interior, extending
to the far south. On this line it is more common in
Western Unyamwezi, where, and where only, an intoxicating
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-181">[181]</span>
toddy is drawn from the cut frond, than elsewhere.
The country abounded in game, but we were
both too weak to work&mdash;my companion, indeed, was compelled
to lag behind&mdash;and the Baloch, to whom the guns
were lent, returned empty-handed. Sign of the Mbogo
(<i>Bos Caffer</i>) here appeared; it is general in East Africa,
especially upon the river plains where water abounds.
These wild cattle are fine animals, somewhat larger than
the common-sized English bullock, with uniform dun
skins, never parti-coloured like the tame herds, and with
thick black-brown horns, from twelve to thirteen inches
broad at the base, diverging outwards, and incurved at
the points, which in large specimens are distant about
three feet from each other; they are separated by a
narrow channel, and this in age becomes a solid mass of
bone. The Mbogo is as dull of comprehension as it is
fierce and powerful; affecting particular spots, it will
often afford several chances of a successful shot to the
Fundi&mdash;Shikari, or Chasseur&mdash;of a caravan: the Africans
kill it with arrows. The flesh, though considered heating
and bilious, is eaten, and the hide is preferred for
thongs and reins to that of the tame animal.</p>

<p>The approach to the kraal was denoted by a dead
level of dry, caked, and cracked mud, showing the subsidence
of an extensive inundation. We passed a large
camping-ground, affected by down-caravans, on the near
side of the Makata, a long river-like “tank,” whose lay
is E. by N. The oozy banks of this water, which is
said to flow after rains into the Mukondokwa River, are
fringed with liliaceous and other large aquatic plants;
the water, though dark, is potable. After fording the
tank, which was then breast-deep, we found on the further
side the kraal used by porters of up-caravans, who
sensibly avoid commencing the day with hard labour, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-182">[182]</span>
who fear that a sudden fall of rain might compel them
to intempestive halts. In such places, throughout the
country, there are two distinct khambi, one on each
side of the obstacle, whether this be a river, a pass, or
a populous clearing; in the latter case, caravans unload
at the farther end of the cultivation, prepared to escape
from a fray into the jungle, without running the gauntlet
of the villages. That evening I tried to reduce the
ever-increasing baggage of the sons of Ramji, who
added to the heaps piled upon the wretched asses, now
burdened with rations for several days, their drums and
sleeping-hides, and their cocks and hens, whilst they left
the beds and the cooking-utensils of the Goanese upon
the ground. They informed me that if our animals
could not carry their property, they could not drive
our animals. The reply was significant. With some
exertion of the “rascally virtue”&mdash;Prudence&mdash;I
retired.</p>

<p>The night was disturbed only by mosquitoes. These
piping pests, however, are less troublesome in this part of
East Africa than might be expected from the nature and
the position of the country, and the bite has little venom
compared with those of the Mozambique, or even of
Western India. The common culex is a large variety, of
brownish or dun colour; its favourite breeding-places
are the backwaters on the banks of rivers, and the margins
of muddy pools, and upon the creeks of the maritime
regions, and the Central Lakes.</p>

<p>Pursuing our march on the next day, I witnessed a
curious contrast in this strange African nature, which
is ever in extremes, and where extremes ever meet,
where grace and beauty are seldom seen without a sudden
change to a hideous grotesqueness. A splendid
view charmed me in the morning. Above lay a sky of
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-183">[183]</span>
purest azure, flaked with fleecy opal-tinted vapours
floating high in the empyrean, and catching the first
roseate smiles of the unrisen sun. Long lines, one
bluer than the other, broken by castellated crags and
towers of most picturesque form, girdled the far horizon;
the nearer heights were of a purplish-brown, and
snowy mists hung like glaciers about their folds. The
plain was a park in autumn, burnt tawny by the sun,
patched with a darker hue where the people were firing
the grass&mdash;a party was at work merrily, as if preparing
for an English harvest-home&mdash;to start the animals,
to promote the growth of a young crop, and, such
is the popular belief, to attract rain. Calabashes, Palmyras,
Tamarinds, and clumps of evergreen trees were scattered
over the scene, each stretching its lordly arms over
subject circlets of deep dew-fed verdure. Here the dove
cooed loudly, and the guinea-fowl rang its wild cry,
whilst the peewit chattered in the open stubble, and a
little martin, the prettiest of its kind, contrasted by its
nimble dartings along the ground with the condor
wheeling slowly through the upper air. The most
graceful of animals, the zebra and the antelope, browsed
in the distance: now they stood to gaze upon the long
line of porters, then, after leisurely pacing, with retrospective
glances, in an opposite direction, they halted
motionless for a moment, faced about once more to
satiate curiosity, and lastly, terrified by their own
fancy, they bounded in ricochets over the plain.</p>

<p>About noon the fair scene vanished as if by enchantment.
We suddenly turned northwards into a tangled
mass of tall fetid reeds, rank jungle and forest, with its
decaying trunks encroaching upon the hole-pierced goat-track
that zigzaged towards the Myombo River. This
perennial stream rises, according to the guides, in an
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-184">[184]</span>
elevation opposite to the highlands of Dut’humi. It is
about fifty feet broad at the ford, breast-deep, and the
swift brown waters swirl under a canopy of the trees
whose name it bears. The “Myombo” is a fine specimen
of African timber, apparently unknown to the
people of Zanzibar, but extending almost from the coast
to the Lake Regions. The flower is greenish, with the
overpowering smell of the Indian jasmines; the fruit is
a large pod, containing ten or twelve long hard acorns,
of a brown-black colour, set in cups which resemble
red sealing-wax. The coarse bark is used for building
huts and kraals, the inner fibre for “bast” and ropes,
and the wood makes what Easterns call a hot fire, lasting
long, and burning well out. After the fiery sun
and the dry atmosphere of the plains, the sudden effect
of the dank and clammy chill, the result of exceeding
evaporation, under the impervious shades that line the
river banks, was overpowering. In such places one
feels as if poisoned by miasma; a shudder runs
through the frame; and a cold perspiration, like
the prelude for a fainting-fit, breaks from the brow.
Unloading the asses, and fording the stream, we
ascended the left bank, and occupied a kraal, with
fires still smoking, on its summit. Though another
porter was left behind with small-pox, I had
little difficulty with the luggage on this march: the
more I worked the men, the harder they worked.
Besides, they seldom fell sick on the road, though often
prostrated when halting, a phenomenon which my companion
explained by their hard eating and little exercise
when stationary, and which Said bin Salim more
mercifully attributed to the fatigue and exposure of the
journey taking effect when the excitement had passed
away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-185">[185]</span></p>

<p>At dawn on the 23rd of August we resumed our
journey, and in 4<sup>hrs</sup> 30′ concluded the transit of the
lateral plain, which separates the Rufuta from the
Mukondokwa Range. The path wound over a wintry
land, green with vegetation only in the vicinity
of water. After struggling through a forest of canes,
we heard a ngoma, or large drum, which astonished
us, as we had not expected to find a village. Presently,
falling into a network of paths, we lost our way. After
long wandering we came upon a tobacco-field which the
Baloch and the sons of Ramji had finished stripping,
and conducted by some Wanyamwezi who had delayed
returning to guide us, in order to indulge their love for
drumming and plundering, we arrived at the débris of a
once flourishing village of Wasagara, called Mbumi from
its headman. A pitiable scene here presented itself.
The huts were torn and half-burnt, and the ground was
strewed with nets and drums, pestles and mortars, cots
and fragments of rude furniture; and though no traces
of blood were observed, it was evident that a Commando
had lately taken place there. Said bin Salim opined this
ruin to be the work of Khalfan bin Salim, the youth who
had preceded us from Muhama; ever suspicious, he saw
in it a plan adopted by the coast-Arab in order to raise
against us the people of the mountains. Kidogo, observing
that the damage was at least ten days’ old,
more acutely attributed it to the Moslem kidnappers
of Whinde, who, aided by the terrible Kisabengo, the
robber-chief of Ukami, near K’hutu, harry the country
with four or five hundred guns. Two of the wretched
villagers were seen lurking in the jungle, not daring to
revisit the wreck of their homes. Here again the Demon
of Slavery will reign over a solitude of his own creation.
Can it be that, by some inexplicable law, where Nature
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-186">[186]</span>
has done her best for the happiness of mankind, man,
doomed to misery, must work out his own unhappiness?
That night was spent at the deserted village by our men
in drumming, singing, and gleaning all that Khalfan’s
gang had left; they were, moreover, kept awake by fear
lest they might be surprised by the remnants of the
villagers.</p>

<p>Late in the morning of the 24th of August, after
losing another ass, torn by a cynhyæna, we followed the
path that leads from Mbumi along the right bank of the
Mukondokwa River to its ford. The marcescent vegetation,
and the tall, stiff, and thick-stalked grass, dripped
with dew, which struck cold as a freezing-mixture. The
path was slippery with mud, and man and beast were rendered
wild by the cruel stings of a small red ant and a
huge black pismire. The former cross the road in dense
masses like the close columns of an army. They are
large-headed, showing probably that they are the defenders
of the republic, and that they perform the duties
of soldiers in their excursions. Though they cannot
spring, they show great quickness in fastening themselves
to the foot or ankle as it brushes over them. The
pismire, known to the people as the “chungu-fundo,” or
“siyafu” from the Arabic “siyaf,” is a horse-ant, about
an inch in length, whose bulldog-like head and powerful
mandibles enable it to destroy rats and mice, lizards
and snakes. It loves damp places upon the banks of
rivers and stagnant waters; it burrows but never raises
hills, and it appears scattered for miles over the paths.
Like the other species, it knows neither fear nor sense of
fatigue; it rushes to annihilation without hesitating,
and it cannot be expelled from a hut except by fire or
boiling water. Its bite, which is the preamble to its
meal, burns like a pinch with a red-hot needle; and when
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-187">[187]</span>
it sets to work, twisting itself round and “accroupi” in
its eagerness for food, it may be pulled in two without
relaxing its hold. The favourite food of this pismire is
the termite: its mortal enemy is a large ginger-coloured
ant, called from its painful wound “maji m’oto,” or “hot-water.”
In this foul jungle our men also suffered severely
from the tzetze. This fly, the torment of Cape
travellers, was limited, by Dr. Livingstone, to the regions
south of the Zambezi river. A specimen, brought home
by me and submitted to Mr. Adam White, of the British
Museum, was pronounced by him to be a true Glossina
morsitans, and Mr. Petherick has fixed its limits about
eight degrees north of the equator. On the line followed
by the Expedition, the tzetze was found extending from
Usagara westward as far as the Central Lakes; its usual
habitat is the jungle-strip which encloses each patch
of cultivated ground, and in the latter it is rarely
seen. It has more persistency of purpose even than the
Egyptian fly, and when beaten off it will return half a
dozen times to the charge; it cannot be killed except by
a smart blow, and its long sharp proboscis draws blood
even through a canvas hammock. It is not feared by
the naked traveller; the sting is as painful as that of an
English horsefly, and leaves a lasting trace, but this hard-skinned
people expect no evil consequences from it. In
the vicinity of Kilwa it was heard of under the name of
“kipanga,” the “little sword.” It is difficult to conceive
the purpose for which this plague was placed in a land
so eminently fitted for breeding cattle and for agriculture,
which without animals cannot be greatly extended,
except as an exercise for human ingenuity to remove.
Possibly at some future day, when the country becomes
valuable, the tzetze may be exterminated by the introduction
of some insectivorous bird, which will
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-188">[188]</span>
be the greatest benefactor that Central Africa ever
knew.</p>

<p>After about an hour’s march, the narrow tunnel in the
jungle&mdash;it was so close that only one ass could be led
up and unloaded at a time&mdash;debouched upon the Mukondokwa
ford. The view was not unpleasing. The
swift brown stream was broadened by a branch-islet
in its upper bed to nearly a hundred yards, and its
margins were fringed with rushes backed by a
screen of dense verdure and tall trees which occupied
the narrow space between the water and the
hills. The descent and the landing-place were
equally bad. Slipping down the steep miry bank
the porters sank into the river breast-deep, causing
not a little damage to their loads: the ford now wetted
the waist then the knee, and the landing-place was a
kind of hippopotamus-run of thick slushy mud, floored
with roots and branches, snags and sawyers, and backed
by a quagmire rendered passable only by its matwork
of tough grass-canes laid by their own weight. Having
crossed over on our men’s backs, we ascended a little
rise and lay down somewhat in the condition of travelling
Manes fresh from the transit of the Styx. I
ordered back Kidogo with a gang of porters to assist
Said bin Salim who was bringing up the rear: he promised
to go but he went the wrong way&mdash;forwards.
Resuming our march along the river’s left or northern
bank, we wound along the shoulders and the bases of
hills, sometimes ascending the spurs of stony and jungly
eminences, where the paths were unusually rough and
precipitous, at other times descending into the stagnant
lagoons, the reedy and rushy swamps, and the deep
bogs which margin the stream. After a total of six
hours we reached a kraal situated upon the sloping
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-189">[189]</span>
ground at the foot of the northern walls which limit
the grassy river basin: through this the Mukondokwa
flows in a dark turbid stream now narrowed to about
forty feet. The district of “Kadetamare” was formerly
a provisioning station where even cattle were purchaseable,
a rare exception to the rule in the smaller settlements
of Usagara. I at once sent men to collect rations,
none, however, were procurable: meeting a small party
that were bringing grain from Rumuma, they learned
that there was a famine in the land.</p>

<p>At Kadetamare the only pedometer, a patent watch-shaped
instrument, broke down, probably from the
effects of the climate. Whilst carried by my companion
it gave a steady exaggerative rate, but being set to the
usual military pace of 30 inches, when transferred to
the person of “Seedy Bombay” and others, it became
worse than useless, sometimes showing 25 for 13 miles.
I would suggest to future explorers in these regions, as
the best and the most lasting means of measuring
distances, two of the small wheelbarrow perambulators&mdash;it
is vain to put trust in a single instrument&mdash;which can
each be rolled on by one man. And when these are spoilt
or stolen, timing with the watch, and a correct estimate
of the walking rate combined with compass-bearings, the
mean of the oscillations being taken when on the march,
would give a “dead-reckoning,” which checked by latitudes,
as often as the cloudy skies permit, and by a
few longitudes at crucial stations, would afford materials
for a map approximating as nearly to correctness
as could be desired in a country where a “handful of
miles” little matters. The other instruments, though
carefully protected from the air, fared not better than
the pedometer: with three pocket-chronometers and a
valuable lever-watch, we were at last reduced to find
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-190">[190]</span>
time by a sixpenny sun-dial. Before the first fortnight
after our second landing in Africa had elapsed, all these
instruments, notwithstanding the time and trouble devoted
to them by my companion, at Zanzibar, failed in
their ratings and became useless for chronometric longitudes.
Two of them (Ed. Baker, London, No. 863,
and Barraud, London, No. 2/537), stopped without apparent
reason. A third, a first-rate article (Parkinson
and Frodsham, No. 2955), issued to me from the Royal
Observatory Greenwich, at the kind suggestion of Capt.
Belcher, of the Admiralty, had its glass broken and its
second-hand lost by the blunderer Gaetano: we remedied
that evil by counting the ticks without other
trouble than that caused by the odd number,&mdash;5 to 2
seconds. This instrument also summarily struck work
on the 9th November, 1858, the day before we intended
to have “made a night of it” at Jiwe la Mkoa. This may
serve as a warning for future travellers to avoid instruments
so delicate that a jolt will disorder them&mdash;the
hair-spring of the lever watch was broken by my companion
in jumping out of a canoe&mdash;and which no one but
a professional can attempt to repair. A box chronometer
carried in a “petarah” by a pole swung between
two men so as to preserve its horizontality, might outlast
the pocket-instruments, yet we read in Capt. Owens
celebrated survey of the African coasts, that out of
nine not one kept rate without fluctuations. The best
plan would be to purchase half-a-dozen sound second-hand
watches, carefully inspected and cleaned, and to
use one at a time; if gold-mounted, they would form
acceptable presents to the Arabs, and ultimately would
prove economical by obviating the necessity of parting
with more valuable articles.</p>

<p>The break-down of the last chronometer disheartened
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-191">[191]</span>
us for a time. Presently when our brains, addled by
sun and sickness, had recovered tone by a return to the
Usagara sanitarium, we remembered a rough and ready
succedaneum for instruments. I need scarcely tell
the reader that, unhappily for travellers, the only means
of ascertaining the longitude of a place is by finding
the difference between the local and Greenwich times,
and that this difference of time with certain corrections
is converted into distance of space. We split a 4 oz.
rifle-ball, inserted into it a string measuring 39 inches
from the point of suspension to the centre of the
weight, and fixed it by hammering the halves together.
The loose end of the cord was attached to a three-edged
file as a pivot, and this was lashed firmly to
the branch of a tree sheltered as much as possible
from the wind. Local time was ascertained with a
sextant by taking the altitude of a star or a planet;
Greenwich time by a distance between the star or
planet and the moon, and the vibrations of our rude
pendulum did all that a watch could do, by registering
the seconds that elapsed between the several observations.</p>

<p>I am somewhat presuming upon the subject, but perhaps
it may here be better to chronicle the accidents
which happened to the rest of our instruments. We
had two Schmalcalder’s compasses (H. Barron &amp; Co.,
26, Oxenden Street), which, when the paste-board
faces had been acclimatized and no longer curled up
against their glasses, did good service; one of them was
trodden upon by my companion, the other by a sailor
during a cruise on the lake. We returned with a
single instrument, the gift of my old friend Lieut.-General
Monteith; it had surveyed Persia, and outlasting
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-192">[192]</span>
two long excursions into Eastern Africa, it still
outlives and probably will outlive many of the showy
articles now supplied by the trade. Finally, a ship’s
compass, mounted in gimbals for boat-work and indented
for upon the Engineer’s Stores, Bombay, soon
became lumber, its oscillations were too sluggish to be
useful.</p>

<p>We left Kadetamare on the 25th August, to ascend
the fluviatile valley of the Mukondokwa. According
to the guides this stream is the upper course of the
Kingani River, with which it anastomoses in Uzaramo(?)
It cuts its way through the chain to which it
gives a name, by a transversal valley perpendicular to
the lay, and so conveniently disposed that the mountains
seem rather to be made for their drain than the
drain for its mountains. The fluviatile valley is apparently
girt on all sides by high peaks, with homesteads
smoking and cattle grazing on all sides. Crippled by
the night-cold that rose from the river-bed, and then
wet through with the dew that dripped from the tall
grass, we traversed, within ear-shot of the frightened
villagers who hailed one another from the heights,
some fields of grain and tobacco that had been lately
reaped. After an hour and a-half of marching
we arrived at the second ford of the Mukondokwa.
Receiving less drainage than in the lower bed, the
stream was narrower and only knee-deep; the landing-place
of sloppy mud caused, however, many accidents
to the asses, and on inspecting our stores a few
days afterwards we found them all soft and mildewed.
The reader will wonder that on these occasions
we did not personally inspect the proceedings of our
careless followers. The fact is we were physically and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-193">[193]</span>
morally incapacitated for any exertion beyond balancing
ourselves upon the donkeys; at Kadetamare I had
laid in another stock of fever, and my companion had not
recovered from his second severe attack. After fording
the Mukondokwa we followed the right bank through
cultivation, grass, and trees, up a gradually broadening
valley peculiarly rich in field-rats. The path then crossing
sundry swamps and nullahs, hill-spurs and “neat’s
tongues,” equally rough thorny and precipitous, presently
fell into a river-reach where pools of water,
breast deep, and hedged in by impassable jungle and long
runs of slushy mire festering in a furious sun, severely
tried the porters and asses. Thence the road wound
under the high hills to the South, whose flanks were
smoking with extensive conflagrations, whilst on the opposite
or left bank of the river, the opening valley displayed
a forest of palms and tall trees. About 2 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>
I reached the ground, a hutless circle of thorns,
called by our people Muinyi: the rear-guard, however,
did not straggle in before 6 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, and the exhaustion of
the asses&mdash;seventeen now remained&mdash;rendered a day’s
halt necessary.</p>

<p>During the last two marches the Baloch had been,
they declared, without grain; the sons of Ramji and
the porters, more provident, had reserved a small store,
moreover they managed to procure a sheep from the next
station. On the morrow a party, headed by Muinyi
Wazira, set out to forage among the mountain settlements,
bearing no arms in token of peace. About noon
they returned, and reported that at the sight of
strangers the people had taken to flight, after informing
the party that they were in the habit of putting to
death all Murungwana or freemen found trespassing off
the road; however, that on this occasion the lives of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-194">[194]</span>
strangers should be spared. But Ambari, a slave belonging
to Said bin Salim, presently tattled the true tale.
The gallant foragers had not dared to enter the village;
when the war-cry flew from hamlet to hamlet, and all
the Wasagara, even the women and children, seized their
spears and stood to arms, they at once threw themselves
into the jungle and descended the hill with such unseemly
haste that most of them bore the wounds of
thorns and stones. Two of Baloch, Riza and Belok,
lit their matches and set out proudly to provide themselves
by their prowess; they were derided by Kidogo:
“Verily, O my brethren! ye go forth to meet men and
not women!” and after a hundred yards’ walk they
took second thoughts and returned. The Mukondokwa
Mountains, once a garden, have become a field for fray
and foray; cruelty and violence have brutalised the
souls of the inhabitants, and they have learned, as
several atrocities committed since our passage through
the country prove, to wreak their vengeance upon all
weaker than themselves.</p>

<p>On the 27th August we resumed our way under fresh
difficulties. The last march had cost us another ass.
Muhinna, a donkey-driver, complaining of fever, had
been mounted by Kidogo without my permission, and
had summarily departed, thus depriving us of the services
of a second, whilst all were in a state of weakness
which compelled them to walk at their slowest pace. On
the other hand, the men of the caravan, hungry and
suffering from raw south-east wind and the chilly cold,
the result not of low temperature but of humidity and
extensive evaporation, were for pushing forward as fast
as possible. The path was painful, winding along the
shoulders of stony and bushy hills, with rough re-entering
angles, and sometimes dipping down into the valley of
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-195">[195]</span>
the Mukondokwa, which, hard on the right, spread out
in swamps, nearly two miles broad, temporary where they
depended upon rain, and permanent where their low
levels admitted of free infiltration. On the steep eminences
to the left of the path rose tall and thick the thorny
aloetic and cactaceous growth of arid Somaliland; the
other side was a miniature of the marine lagoons, the
creeks, and the bayous of green Zanzibar. After three
hours of hard marching, the labour came to its crisis,
where the path, breaking off at a right angle from the river,
wound up an insecure ladder of loose earth and stones,
which caused several porters and one ass to lose their
footing, and to roll with their loads through the thorny
bushes of the steep slope, near the off side, into the bed
of rushes below. Then leaving the river-valley on the
right, we fell into a Fiumara of deep loose sand, about a
hundred yards broad, and occupying the centre of a
widening table-land. The view now changed, and the
“wady” afforded pleasant glimpses of scenery. Its
broad, smooth and glistening bed, dinted by the footprints
of cattle, was bounded by low perpendicular
banks of stiff red clay, margined by mighty masses of
brilliant green tamarinds, calabashes, and sycomores,
which stood sharply out against the yellow stubbles beyond
them. The Mkuyu or sycomore in Eastern
Africa is a magnificent tree; the bole, composed of
a pillared mass, averages from eight to ten feet in
height, and the huge branches, thatched with thick cool
foliage, extend laterally, overshadowing a circle whose
perimeter, when the sun is vertical, sometimes attains
five hundred feet. The fruit, though eaten by travellers,
is a poor berry, all rind and seeds, with a slender title
to the name of fig. There are apparently two varieties
of this tree, resembling each other in general appearance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-196">[196]</span>
but differing in details. The Mtamba has a large, heavy,
and fleshy leaf; its fruit is not smooth like that of the
Mkuyu, but knobbed with green excrescences, and the
bole is loftier than the common sycomore’s trunk. The
roots of the older trees, rising above the earth, draw up
a quantity of mould which, when the wood is decayed
or destroyed, forms the dwarf mounds that in many parts
encumber the surface of the country. Traces of extensive
cultivation&mdash;fields of bajri or panicum, the staple
cereal which here supplants the normal African holcus,
or Kafir corn, and plantations of luxuriant maize, of
beans, of the vetch known as the voiandzeia subterranea,
of tobacco, and other plants&mdash;showed that this district is
beyond the reach of the coast-kidnappers. From the rising
ground on the left hand we heard the loud tattoo of the
drum. The Baloch, choosing to be alarmed, fired several
shots, much to the annoyance of the irascible Kidogo, who
had laid down as a law that waste of powder in this region
was more likely to invite than to prevent an attack. As
we ascended the Fiumara it narrowed rapidly, and its
head was encumbered with heaps of boulders from which
sprang a runnel of the sweetest water. The camping-ground
was upon the left bank of the bed. The guide
called it Ndábi, probably from a small gnarled tree here
abundant, bearing a fruit like a pale red currant, which
tastes like sweetened gum dissolved in dirty water. I
lost no time in sending for provisions, which were scarce
and dear. Bombay failed in procuring a sheep, though the
Baloch, by paying six cloths, were more fortunate. One
of Kidogo’s principles of action, in which he was abetted
by Said bin Salim, was to prevent our buying provisions,
however necessary, at high prices, fearing lest the tariff
thus established might become an “ada,” a precedent or
custom for future travellers, himself and others. We
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-197">[197]</span>
were, therefore, fain to content ourselves and our servants
with a little bajri and two eggs.</p>

<p>After a day’s halt at Ndabi we resumed the journey
on the 29th August. The path crossed a high and
stony hill-shoulder, where the bleak raw air caused one
of the porters to lie down torpid like a frozen man. It
then stretched over gradually rising and falling ground
to a dense bush of cactaceæ and milk-bush, aloetic plants
and thorns, based upon a surface of brickdust-red. Beyond
this point lay another plateau of wavy surface,
producing dwarfed and wind-wrung calabashes, and
showing grain-fields carefully and laboriously ridged with
the hoe. Flocks and herds now appeared in all directions.
The ground was in some places rust-coloured, in
others dazzlingly white with a detritus of granite; mica
glittered like silver-filings in the sun, and a fine silky
grass waved in the wind, bleached clean of colour by the
glowing rays. This plateau ended in a descent with
rapid slopes, over falls and steps of rock and boulder
into the basin of the Rumuma River. It is a southern
influent, or a bifurcation of the Mukondokwa, and
it drains the hills to the south-west of the Rumuma
district, whereas the main stream, arising in the highlands
of the Wahumba or Wamusai, carries off the
waters of the lands on the west. Losing our way,
we came upon this mountain-torrent, which swirls
through blocks and boulders under stiff banks of red
earth densely grown with brush and reeds; and to
find the kraal we were obliged to travel up the bed-side,
through well-hoed fields irrigated by raised water-courses.
The khambi was badly situated in the dwarf hollow between
the river and the hills, and having lately been
tenanted, as the smoking embers showed, it was uncleanly
in the extreme. It was heart-breaking to see the asses
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-198">[198]</span>
that day. I left them to Said bin Salim, who, with
many others, did not appear till eventide.</p>

<p>Rumuma is a favourite resting-place with caravans,
on account of the comparative abundance of its supplies.
I halted here two whole days, to rest and feed
the starving porters, and to repair the sacks, the pack-saddles,
and the other appointments of the asses. Here,
for the first time, the country people descended in
crowds from the hills, bringing fowls, hauling along
small but beautifully formed goats, lank sheep, and fine
bullocks&mdash;the latter worth twelve cloths&mdash;and carrying
on their heads basket-platters full of the Voandzeia,
bajri, beans, and the <i>Arachis Hypogæa</i>. The latter is
called by the Arabs Sumbul el Sibal, or “Monkey’s
Spikenard;” on the coast, Njugu ya Nyassa; in Unyamwezi,
Karanga or K’haranga, and further west, Mayowwa
or Mwanza. It is the Bhuiphali, or “earth-fruit”
of India, and the Bik’han of Maharatta land,
where it is used by cheap confectioners in the place of
almonds, whose taste it simulates. Our older Cape travellers
term it the pig-nut. The plant extends itself
along the surface of the ground, and puts forth its fruit
at intervals below. It is sown before the rains, and
ripens after six months,&mdash;in the interior about June.
The Arabs fry it with cream that has been slightly
salted, and employ it in a variety of rich dishes; it
affords them also a favourite oil. The Africans use it
principally on journeys. The price greatly varies according
to the abundance of the article; when moderate,
about two pounds may be purchased for a “khete” of
coral beads.</p>

<p>The Wasagara of Rumuma are short, black, beardless
men. They wear their hair combed off the forehead,
and twisted into a fringe of little pig-tails, which
extend to the nape of the neck. Few boast of cloth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-199">[199]</span>
the general body contenting themselves with a goat-skin
flap somewhat like a cobbler’s apron tied over
one shoulder, as we sling a game-bag. Their ornaments
are zinc and brass earrings in rolls, which
distend the ear-lobe, bangles, or armlets of similar
metal, and iron chains with oblong links as anklets.
Their arms are bows and arrows, assegais with long
lanceated heads, and bull-hide shields, three feet
long by one broad, painted black and red in perpendicular
stripes. I was visited by their Sultan
Njasa, a small grizzled old man, with eyes reddened by
liquor, a wide mouth, a very thin beard, a sooty skin,
and long straggling hair, “<i>à la malcontent</i>.” He was
attired in an antiquated Barsati, or blue and red Indian
cotton, tucked in at the waist, with another
thrown over his shoulders, and his neck was decked
with many strings of beads. He insisted upon making
“sare” or brotherhood with Said bin Salim, who being
forbidden by his law to taste blood, made the unconscientious
Muinyi Wazira his proxy. The two brothers
being seated on the ground opposite each other, with
legs well to the fore, one man held over their heads a
drawn sword, whilst another addressed to them alternately
a little sermon, denouncing death or slavery as
the penalty for proving false to the vow. Then each
brother licked a little of the other’s blood, taken with
the finger from a knife-cut above the heart, or rather
where the heart is popularly supposed to be. The Sultan
then presented to the Muinyi, <i>in memoriam</i>, a neat
iron chain-anklet, and the Muinyi presented to the Sultan
a little of our cloth.</p>

<p>The climate of Rumuma was new to me, after the incessant
rains of the maritime valley, and the fogs and
mists of the Rufuta Range. It was, however, in extremes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-200">[200]</span>
At night the thermometer, under the influence
of dewy gusts, sank in the tent to 48° F., a killing temperature
in these latitudes to half-naked and houseless
men. During the day the mercury ranged between 80°
and 90° F.; the sun was fiery, whilst a furious south
wind coursed through skies purer and bluer than I had
ever seen in Greece or Italy. At times, according to
the people, the hill-tops are veiled, especially in the
mornings and evenings, with thick nimbus, vapours,
and spitting clouds, which sometimes extend to the
plain, and discharge heavy showers that invariably
cause sickness. Here my companion once more suffered
from an attack of “liver,” brought on, he supposed,
from over-devotion to a fat bullock’s hump. Two of
the Wanyamwezi porters were seized with preliminary
symptoms of small-pox, euphuistically termed by Said
bin Salim “shurua,” or chicken-pox. Several of the
slaves, including the charming Halimah, were laid up;
the worst of all, however, was Valentine, who complained
of an unceasing racking headache, whilst his puffed
cheeks and dull-yellow skin gave him the look of one
newly deceased. At length, divining his complaint, he
was cupped by a Mnyamwezi porter, and he recovered
after the operation strength and appetite.</p>

<p>The 2nd of September saw us <i>en route</i> to Márengá
Mk’hali, or the “brackish water.” Fording the Rumuma
above the spot where it receives the thin supplies
of the Márengá Mk’hali, we marched over stony hills
and thorny bushes, dotted with calabash and mimosa,
the castor-shrub and the wild egg-plant, and gradually
rising, we passed into scattered fields of holcus and
bajri, pulse and beans. Here, for the first time, bee-hives,
called by the coast-people Mazinga, or cannons, from
their shape, hollowed cylindrical logs, closed with grass
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-201">[201]</span>
and puddle at both ends, and provided with an oval
opening in the centre, were seen hanging to the branches
of the foliaged trees. Cucumbers, water-melons, and
pumpkins grew apparently without cultivation. The
water-melon, called by the Arabs Johh, and by the
Wasawahili Tikiti, flourishes throughout the interior,
where it is a favourite with the people. It is sown before
the rainy season, gathered after six months, and
placed to ripen upon the flat roofs of the villages. Like
the produce of Kafir-land, it is hard, insipid, fleshy,
and full of seeds, having nothing but the name in common
with the delicious fruit of Egypt and Afghanistan.
The Junsal, or Boga, the pumpkin, is, if possible, worse
than the water-melon. Its red meat, simply boiled, is
nauseously sweet; it is, however, considered wholesome,
and the people enjoy the seeds toasted, pounded, and
mixed with the “Mboga,” or wild vegetables, with
which a veritable African can, in these regions, keep
soul and body together for six months. About 10 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>,
I found Khalfan’s caravan halted in a large kraal
amongst the villages, on the eastern hill above the
“brackish water.” They were loading for the march,
and my men looked wistfully at the comfortable huts;
but their halt had been occasioned by small-pox, I therefore
hurried forwards across the streamlet to a wind-swept
summit of an opposite hill. The place was far from
pleasant, the gusts were furious; by night the thermometer
showed 54° F., by day there was but scanty
shelter from the fiery sun, and the “Márengá Mk’hali,”
which afforded the only supplies of water, was at a considerable
distance. Moreover our umbrellas and bedding
suffered severely from a destructive host of white
ants, that here became troublesome for the first time.
The “Chunga Mchwa,” or termite, abounds throughout
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-202">[202]</span>
the sweet red clay soils, and cool damp places, avoiding
heat, sand, and stone, and it acts like a clearer and
scavenger; without it, indeed, some parts of the country
would be impassable, and it is endowed with extraordinary
powers of destruction. A hard clay-bench has
been drilled and pierced like a sieve by these insects in a
single night, and bundles of reeds placed under bedding,
have in a few hours been converted into a mass of mud;
straps were consumed, cloths and umbrellas were reduced
to rags, and the mats used for covering the servants’
sleeping-gear were, in the shortest possible time,
so tattered as to be unserviceable. Man revenges himself
upon the white ant, and satisfies his craving for
animal food, which in these regions becomes a principle
of action,&mdash;a passion,&mdash;by boiling the largest and fattest
kind, and eating it as a relish with his insipid ugali, or
porridge. The termite appears to be a mass of live
water. Even in the driest places it finds no difficulty
in making a clay-paste for the mud-galleries, like hollow
tree-twigs, with which it disguises its approach to
its prey. The phenomenon has been explained by the
conjecture that it combines by vital force the atmospheric
oxygen with the hydrogen evolved by its food.
When arrived at the adult state, the little peoples rise
ready-winged, like thin curls of pipe-smoke, generally
about even-tide, from the ground. After a flight of a
few yards, the fine membranes, which apparently serve
to disperse the insects into colonies, drop off. In East
Africa there is also a semi-transparent brown ant, resembling
the termite in form, but differing in habits,
and even exceeding it in destructiveness. It does not,
like its congener, run galleries up to the point of attack.
Each individual works for itself in the open air, tears
the prey with its strong mandibles, and carries it away
to its hole. The cellular hills of the termites in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-203">[203]</span>
country rarely rise to the height of three feet, whereas
in Somali-land they become dwarf towers, forming a
conspicuous feature in the view.</p>

<p>No watch was kept by the Baloch at Márengá Mk’hali,
though we were then in the vicinity of the bandit Wahumba.
On the next day we were harangued by Kidogo,
who proceeded to expound the principles that
must guide us through the unsafe regions ahead. The
caravan must no longer straggle on in its usual disorder,
the van must stop short when separated from
the main body, and the rear must advance at the
double when summoned by the sound of the Barghumi,
or the koodoo-horn, which acts as bugle in Eastern
Africa. I thought, at the time, that Kidogo might
as well address his admonitions to the wind, and I
thought rightly.</p>

<p>The route lay through the lateral plain which separates
the Mukondokwa or second, from the Rubeho or
third parallel range of the Usagara Mountains. At
Márengá, Mk’hali, situated as it is under the lee of the
two eastern walls, upon which the humid N. E. and
S. E. trade-winds impinge, the eye no longer falls, as
before, upon a sheet of monotonous green, and the nose
is not offended by the death-like exhalations of a pestilent
vegetation. The dew diminishes, the morning-cloud
is rare upon the hill-top, and the stratus is not
often seen in the valley; rain, moreover, seldom falls
heavily, except during its single appointed season. The
climate is said to be salubrious, and the medium elevation
of the land, 2500 feet, raises it high above the
fatal fever-level, without attaining the altitudes where
dysentery and pleurisy afflict the inhabitants. For
many miles beyond Márengá Mk’hali water is rarely
found. Caravans, therefore, resort to what is technically
called a “Tirikeza,” or afternoon march. In the Kisawahili,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-204">[204]</span>
or coast-language, “ku Tirikeza,” or “Tilikeza,” and
in Kinyamwezi, “ku Witekezea,” is the infinitive of a neuter
verb signifying “to march after noon-day”; by the
Arabs it is corrupted into a substantive. Similarly the
verb ku honga, to pay “dash”, tribute, passage-money, or
blackmail, becomes in the mouths of the stranger, ku
honga, or Honga. The tirikeza is one of the severest
inflictions that African travelling knows. At 11 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>
everything is thrown into confusion, although two or
three hours must elapse before departure; loads are
bound up, kitchen-batteries are washed and packed,
tents are thrown, and stools are carried off by fidgeting
porters and excited slaves. Having drunk for the last
time, and filled their gourds for the night, the wayfarers
set out when the midday ends. The sun is far more
severely felt after the sudden change from shade, than
during the morning marches, when its increase of heat is
slow and gradual. They trudge under the fireball in the
firmament, over ground seething with glow and reek,
through an air which seems to parch the eyeballs, and
they endure this affliction till their shadows lengthen
out upon the ground. The tirikeza is almost invariably
a lengthy stage, as the porters wish to abridge
the next morning’s march, which leads to water. It is
often bright moonlight before they arrive at the ground,
with faces torn by the thorns projecting across the
jungly path, with feet lacerated by stone and stub,
and occasionally a leg lamed by stumbling into deep
and narrow holes, the work of field-rats and of various
insects.</p>

<p>We left Márengá Mk’hali at 1 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, on the 3rd September,
and in order to impressionise a large and well-armed
band of the country people that had gathered to
stare at, to criticise, and to deride us, we indulged in
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-205">[205]</span>
a little harmless sword-play, with a vast show of ferocity
and readiness for fight. The road lay over several rough,
steep, and bushy ridges, where the wretched asses,
rushing away to take advantage of a yard of shade,
caused constant delays. The Wanyamwezi animals
having a great persistency of character, could scarcely
be dislodged; and when they were, they threw their
loads in pure spite. After topping a little “col” or
pass, we came in sight of an extensive basin, bounded
by distant blue hills, to which the porters pointed with
a certain awe, declaring them to be the haunts of the
fierce Wahumba. A descent of the western flank led
us to a space partially cleared by burning, when the cry
arose that men were lurking about. We then plunged
into a thick bush of thorny trees, based upon a red
clayey soil caked into the semblance of a rock. Contrary
to expectation, when crossing a deep nullah trending
northwards, we found a little rusty, ochreish water,
in one of the cups and holes that dented the sandstone
of the soles. Thence the path, gradually descending,
fell into a coarse scrub, varied with small open savannahs,
and broken, like the rest of the road, by deep,
narrow watercourses, which carry off the waters of the
southern hills to the northern lowlands. About 6 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>,
we came upon a cleared space in a thick thorn-jungle,
where we established ourselves for the night. The
near whine of the hyæna, and the alarm of the asses,
made sleep a difficulty. The impatience and selfishness
of thirst showed strongly in the Baloch. Belok
had five large gourds full of water, perhaps three gallons,
yet he would not part with a palmful to the sick
Ismail. That day I was compelled to dismiss my usual
ass-leader Shahdad, the zeze-player and fracturer of female
hearts, who preferring the conversation of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-206">[206]</span>
fellows, dragged the animal through thorns and alongside
of trees so artistically, that my nether garments
were soon in strips. I substituted for him Musa the
Greybeard, who, after a few days, begged, with bitter
tears, to be excused. It was his habit to hurry on
towards the kraal and shade, and the slow hobble of the
ass detained him a whole hour in sore discomfort. The
task was then committed to the tailor-youth Hudul, who
lost no time in declaring that I had abused him&mdash;that
he was a Baloch&mdash;that he was not an asinego. Then I
tried Abdullah,&mdash;the good young man. I dismissed him
because every day brought with it a fresh demand for
cloth or beads, gourds or sandals, for a “chit” to the
Balyuz&mdash;the Consul, or a general good character as regards
honesty, virtue, and the <i>et ceteras</i>. Finally the ass
was entrusted to the bull-headed slave Mabruki, who
thinking of nothing but chat with his “brother,” Seedy
Bombay, and having that curious mania for command
which seems part of every servile nature, hurried my
monture so recklessly, that earth-cracks and rat-holes
caused us twain many a severe fall. My companion
had entrusted himself to Bombay, who, though he did
nothing well rarely did anything very badly.</p>

<p>The 4th September began with an hour’s toil through
the dense bush, to a rapid descent over red soil and
rocks, which necessitated frequent dismounting,&mdash;no
pleasant exercise after a sleepless night. Below, lay a
wide basin of rolling ground, surrounded in front by a
rim of hills. It was one of the many views which
“catching the reflex of heaven,” and losing by indistinctness
the harshness of defined outline and the deformity
of individual feature, assume, viewed from afar,
a peculiar picturesqueness. Traces of extensive cultivation,
flocks and herds, were descried in the lower
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-207">[207]</span>
levels, which were a network of sandy nullahs; and
upon the rises, the regular and irregular square or
oblong habitations, called “Tembe,” were seen for the first
time. Early September is, in this region, the depth of
winter. Under the burning, glaring sun, the grass
becomes white as the ground; the fields, stubbles stiff as
harrows, are stained only by the shadow of passing
clouds; the trees, except upon the nullah-banks, are
gaunt and bare, the animals are walking skeletons, and
nothing seems to flourish but flies and white ants,
caltrops and grapple-plants. After crossing deep water-cuts
trending N.E. and N.N.E., we descended a sharp
incline and a rough ladder of boulders, and found a
dirty and confined kraal, on the side of a rocky khad<a id="FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> or
ravine, which drains off the surplus moisture of the
westerly crags and highlands, and which affords sweet
springs, that cover the soil as far as they extend with a
nutritious and succulent grass. As this was to be a
halting-place, a more than usually violent rush was
made by the Baloch, the sons of Ramji, and the
porters, to secure the best quarters. The Jemadar
remaining behind with three of the Wanyamwezi, who
were unable to walk, did not arrive till after noon, and
my companion, suffering from a paroxysm of bilious
fever, came in even later. Valentine was weaker than
usual, and Gaetano groaned more frequently, “ang
duk’hta”&mdash;body pains! To add other troubles, an ass
had been lost, and “Khamsin,”&mdash;No. 50&mdash;my riding-animal,
had by breaking a tooth in fighting incapacitated
itself for food or drink: its feebleness compelled me
to transfer the saddle to the last of the Zanzibar riding-asses,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-208">[208]</span>
Siringe,&mdash;the Quarter-dollar&mdash;and Siringe, sadly
back-sore, cowering in the hams, and slipping from
under me every few minutes, showed present signs of
giving in.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote8"></a><a href="#FNanchor8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
The Indian “khad” is the deep rocky drain in hilly countries, thus
differing from the popular idea of a “ravine,” and from the nullah, which is
a formation in more level lands.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The basin of Inenge lies at the foot of the Rubeho
or “Windy Pass,” the third and westernmost range of
the Usagara Mountains. The climate, like that of
Rumuma, is ever in extremes&mdash;during the day a furnace,
and at night a refrigerator&mdash;the position is a funnel,
which alternately collects the fiery sunbeams and the
chilly winds that pour down from the misty highlands.
The villagers of the settlements overlooking the ravine,
flocked down to barter their animals and grain. Here,
for the first time since our departure from the coast,
honey, clarified butter, and, greatest boon of all, milk,
fresh and sour, were procurable. The man who has
been restricted to a diet so unwholesome as holcus
and bajri, with an occasional treat of kennel-food,&mdash;broth
and beans,&mdash;will understand that the first unexpected
appearance of milk, butter, and honey formed
an epoch in our journey.</p>

<p>The halt was celebrated with abundant drumming and
droning, which lasted half the night; it served to cheer the
spirits of the men, who had talked of nothing the whole
day but the danger of being attacked by the Wahumba.
On the next morning arrived a caravan of about 400
Wanyamwezi porters marching to the coast, under the
command of Isa bin Hijji and three other Arab merchants.
An interchange of civilities took place. The
Arabs lacking cloth could not feed their slaves and
porters, who deserted daily, imperilling a valuable
investment in ivory. The Europeans could afford a
small contribution of three Gorah or pieces of
domestics: they received a present of fine white
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-209">[209]</span>
rice, a few pounds of salt, and a goat, in exchange
for a little perfumed snuff and assafœtida, which after
a peculiar infusion is applied to wounds, and which, administered
internally, is considered a remedy for many
complaints. I was allured to buy a few yards of rope,
indispensable for packing the animals. The number of
our asses being reduced from thirty to fifteen, and the
porters from thirty-six to thirty, it was necessary to
recruit. The Arabs sold two Wanyamwezi animals for
ten dollars each, payable at Zanzibar. One proved
valuable as a riding ass, and carried me to the Central
Lake, and back to Unyanyembe: the other, though caponized
and blind on the off-side, had become by bad treatment
so obstinate and so cleverly vicious, that the Baloch
called him “Shaytan yek-cham,” or the “one-eyed
fiend:” he carried, besides sundries, four boxes of ammunition,
weighing together 160 pounds, and even under
these he danced like a deer. Nothing was against him
but his character: after a few days he was cast adrift in
the wilderness of Mgunda M’khali, because no man
dared to load and lead him. Knowing that the Arab
merchants upon this line hold it a point of honour to
discourage, by refusing a new engagement, the down-porters
in their proclivity to desert, and believing that
it was a stranger’s duty to be even stricter than they
are, I gave most stringent orders that any fugitive
porter detected in my caravan should be sent back a
prisoner to his employers. But the Coast-Arabs and
the Wasawahili ignore this commercial chivalry, and
shamelessly offer a premium to “levanters:” moreover,
in these lands it is hard to make men understand the
<i>rapport</i> between sayings and doings. Seven or eight
fellows, who secretly left the party, were sent back;
one, however, was taken on without my knowledge.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-210">[210]</span>
Said bin Salim persuaded the merchants to lend us the
services of three Wanyamwezi, who for sums varying from
eight Shukkah to two cloths, and a coil large enough
to make three wire bracelets, undertook to carry packs
as far as Unyanyembe. Our Ras Kafilah had increased
in Uzaramo his suite by the addition of “Zawada,”&mdash;the
“nice gift,” a parting present of the headman
Kizaya. She was a woman about thirty, with a black
skin shining like a patent-leather boot, a bulging brow,
little red eyes, a wide mouth which displayed a few long,
strong, scattered teeth, and a figure considerably too
bulky for her thin legs, which were unpleasantly straight,
like ninepins. Her <i>morale</i> was superior to her <i>physique</i>;
she was a patient and hard-working woman, and respectable
in the African acceptation of the term. She was at
once married off to old Musangesi, one of the donkey-men,
whose nose and chin made him a caricature of our
dear old friend Punch. After detecting her in a lengthy
walk, perhaps not solitary, through the jungle, he was
palpably guilty of such cruelty that I felt compelled to
decree a dissolution of the marriage. After passing
through sundry adventures she returned safely to Zanzibar,
where, for aught I know, she may still grace
the harem of Said bin Salim. At Inenge another female
slave was added to the troop, in the person of the lady
Sikujui, “Don’t know,” a “mulier nigris dignissima
barris,” whose herculean person and virago manner
raised her value to six cloths and a large coil of brass
wire. The channel of her upper lip had been pierced to
admit a disk of bone; her Arab master had attempted
to correct the disfigurement by scarification and the use
of rock-salt, yet the distended muscles insisted upon projecting
sharply from her countenance, like a duck’s bill,
or the beak of an ornithorhyncus. This truly African
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-211">[211]</span>
ornamentation would have supplied another instance to
the ingenious author of “Anthropometamorphosis.”<a id="FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
“Don’t know’s” morals were frightful. She was duly
espoused&mdash;as the forlorn hope of making her an “honest
woman”&mdash;to Goha, the sturdiest of the Wak’hutu porters;
after a week she treated him with a sublime contempt.
She gave him first one, then a dozen rivals;
she disordered the caravan by her irregularities; she
broke every article entrusted to her charge, as the
readiest way of lightening her burden, and&mdash;“le moindre
défaut d’une femme galante est de l’être”&mdash;she deserted
so shamelessly that at last Said bin Salim disposed of
her, at Unyanyembe, for a few measures of rice, to a
travelling trader, who came the next morning to complain
of a broken head.</p>

<p>Isa bin Hijji did us various good services. He and
his companions kindly waited some days to superintend
our preparations for crossing the Rubeho Range. They
supplied useful hints for keeping the caravan together
at different places infamous for desertion. They gave
me valuable information about Ugogo and Ujiji, and
they placed at my disposal their house at Unyanyembe.
They “wigged” the Kirangozi, or guide, for carelessness
in not building a kraal-fence every night, and for
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-212">[212]</span>
not bringing in, as the custom is, wood and water.
Kidogo was reproved for allowing his men to load our
asses with their luggage, and the Baloch for their continual
complaints about food. The latter had long forgotten
the promises made at Muhama; they returned
at every opportunity to their old tactic, that of obtaining,
by all manner of pretexts, as much cloth and beads as
possible, ostensibly for provisions, really for trading and
buying slaves. At Rumuma they declared that one
cloth per diem starved them. Said bin Salim sent
them its value, about fifty pounds of beans, and they
had abundant rations of beef and mutton, but they
could not eat beans. At Inenge they wanted flour, and
as the country people sold only grain, they gave themselves
up to despair. I sent for the Jemadar and told
him, in presence of the merchants, that, as a fitting
opportunity had presented itself, I was willing to weed
the party, by giving official dismissal to Khudabakhsh
and Belok, to the invalid Ismail and his musical
“brother” Shahdad. All four, when consulted, declared
that they would die rather than blacken their faces by
abandoning the “Haji Abdullah;” that same evening,
however, as I afterwards learned, they wrote, by means
of the Arabs, a heartrending complaint to their chief
Jemadar at Zanzibar, declaring that he had thrown
them into the fire (of affliction), and that their blood
was upon his hands. My companion prepared official
papers and maps for the Secretary of the Royal Geographical
Society, and I again indented upon the Consul
and the Collector of Customs for drugs, medical comforts,
and an extra supply of cloth and beads, to the
extent of 400 dollars, for which a cheque upon my
agents in Bombay was enclosed. The Arabs took leave
of us on the 2nd September. I charged them repeatedly
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-213">[213]</span>
not to spread reports of our illness, and I saw them
depart with regret. It had really been a relief to hear
once more the voice of civility and sympathy.</p>

<p>The great labour still remained. Trembling with
ague, with swimming heads, ears deafened by weakness,
and limbs that would hardly support us, we contemplated
with a dogged despair the apparently perpendicular
path that ignored a zigzag, and the ladders of
root and boulder, hemmed in with tangled vegetation, up
which we and our starving drooping asses were about to
toil. On the 10th September we hardened our hearts, and
began to breast the Pass Terrible. My companion was
so weak that he required the aid of two or three supporters;
I, much less unnerved, managed with one. After
rounding in two places wall-like sheets of rock&mdash;at their
bases green grass and fresh water were standing close to
camp, and yet no one had driven the donkeys to feed&mdash;and
crossing a bushy jungly step, we faced a long steep of
loose white soil and rolling stones, up which we could see
the Wanyamwezi porters swarming, more like baboons
scaling a precipice than human beings, and the asses falling
after every few yards. As we moved slowly and
painfully forwards, compelled to lie down by cough,
thirst, and fatigue, the “sayhah” or war-cry rang loud
from hill to hill, and Indian files of archers and spearmen
streamed like lines of black ants in all directions
down the paths. The predatory Wahumba, awaiting the
caravan’s departure, had seized the opportunity of driving
the cattle and plundering the villages of Inenge. Two
passing parties of men, armed to the teeth, gave us this
information; whereupon the negro “Jelai” proposed,
fear-maddened&mdash;a <i>sauve qui peut</i>&mdash;leaving to their fate
his employers, who, bearing the mark of Abel in this land
of Cain, were ever held to be the head and front of all
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-214">[214]</span>
offence. Khudabakhsh, the brave of braves, being attacked
by a slight fever, lay down, declaring himself
unable to proceed, moaned like a bereaved mother, and
cried for drink like a sick girl. The rest of the Baloch,
headed by the Jemadar, were in the rear; they had
levelled their matchlocks at one of the armed parties
as it approached them, and, but for the interference of
Kidogo, blood would have been shed.</p>

<p>By resting after every few yards, and by clinging to our
supporters, we reached, after about six hours, the summit
of the Pass Terrible, and there we sat down amongst the
aromatic flowers and bright shrubs&mdash;the gift of mountain
dews&mdash;to recover strength and breath. My companion
could hardly return an answer; he had advanced
mechanically and almost in a state of coma. The view
from the summit appeared eminently suggestive, perhaps
unusually so, because disclosing a retrospect of
severe hardships, now past and gone. Below the foreground
of giant fractures, huge rocks, and detached
boulders, emerging from a shaggy growth of mountain
vegetation, with forest glens and hanging woods, black
with shade gathering in the steeper folds, appeared,
distant yet near, the tawny basin of Inenge, dotted with
large square villages, streaked with lines of tender green,
that denoted the water-courses, mottled by the shadows
of flying clouds, and patched with black where the grass
had been freshly fired. A glowing sun gilded the canopy
of dense smoke which curtained the nearer plain, and
in the background the hazy atmosphere painted with
its azure the broken wall of hill which we had traversed
on the previous day.</p>

<p>Somewhat revived by the <i>tramontana</i> which rolled
like an ice-brook down the Pass, we advanced over an
easy step of rolling ground, decked with cactus and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-215">[215]</span>
flat-topped mimosa, with green grass and bright shrubs,
to a small and dirty khambi, in a hollow flanked by
heights, upon which several settlements appeared. At
this place, called the “Great Rubeho,” in distinction
from its western neighbour, I was compelled to halt.
My invalid sub. had been seized with a fever-fit that
induced a dangerous delirium during two successive
nights; he became so violent that it was necessary to
remove his weapons, and, to judge from certain symptoms,
the attack had a permanent cerebral effect. Death
appeared stamped upon his features, yet the Baloch and
the sons of Ramji clamoured to advance, declaring that
the cold disagreed with them.</p>

<p>On the 12th September the invalid, who, restored
by a cool night, at first proposed to advance, and then
doubted his ability to do so, was yet hesitating when
the drum-signal for departure sounded without my
order. The Wanyamwezi porters instantly set out. I
sent to recal them, but they replied that it was the
custom of their race never to return; a well-sounding
principle against which they never offended except to
serve their own ends. At length a hammock was rigged
up for my companion, and the whole caravan broke
ground.</p>

<p>The path ran along the flank of an eminence, and,
ascending a second step, as steep but shorter than the
Pass Terrible, placed us at the Little Rubeho, or
Windy Pass, the summit of the third and westernmost
range of the Usagara Mountains, raised 5,700 feet above
the sea-level. It is the main water-parting of this ghaut-region.
At Inenge the trend is still to the S.E.; beyond
Rubeho the direction is S.W. Eventually, however,
the drainage of both slope and counter-slope finds
its way to the Indian Ocean, the former through the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-216">[216]</span>
Mukondokwa and the Kingani, the latter through the
Rwaha and the Rufiji Rivers.</p>

<p>A lively scene awaited my arrival at the “Little
Rubeho.” From a struggling mass of black humanity,
which I presently determined to be our porters, proceeded
a furious shouting and yelling. Spears and
daggers flashed in the sun, and cudgels played with a
threshing movement which promised many a broken
head. At the distance of a few yards, with fierce faces and
in motionless martial attitudes, the right hand upon the
axe-handle stuck in the waist-belt, and the left grasping
the bow and two or three polished assegais, stood a
few strong fellows, the forlorn hope of the fray. In
the midst of the crowd, like Norman Ramsay’s troop
begirt by French cavalry&mdash;to compare small things with
great&mdash;rose and fell the chubby, thickset forms of Muinyi
Wazira and his four Wak’hutu, who, undaunted by numbers,
were dealing death to nose and scalp. Charge!
Mavi ya Gnombe (“Bois de Vache”) charge! On!
Mashuzi (“Fish Fry-soup”) on! Bite, Kuffan Kwema
(“To die is good”) bite, Smite, Na daka Mali (“I want
wealth”) smite! At length, when</p>

<p class="noindent">a little active interference rescued the five “enfans
perdus.” The porters had been fighting upon the
question whether the men with small-pox should, or
should not, be admitted into the kraal, and Muinyi
Wazira and his followers, under the influence of potations
which prevented their distinguishing friend from
foe, had proved themselves, somewhat unnecessarily
heroes. It is usually better to let these quarrels work
themselves out; if prematurely cut short, the serpent,
wrath, is scotched, not slain. A little “punishment”
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-217">[217]</span>
always cools the blood, and secures peace and quiet
for the future. Moreover, the busy peacemaker here
often shares the fate of M. Porceaugnac, and earns
the reward of those who, according to the proverb,
in quarrels interpose. It is vain to investigate,
where all is lie, the origin of the squabble. Nothing
easier, as the Welsh justice was fond of declaring, than
to pronounce judgment after listening to one side of the
question; but an impartial hearing of both would strike
the inquiring mind with a sense of impotence. Perhaps
it is not unadvisable to treat the matter after the fashion
adopted by a “police-officer,” a certain captain in the
<i>X. Y. Z.</i> army, who deemed it his duty to discourage
litigiousness and official complaints amongst the
quarrelsome Sindhi population of Hyderabad. The
story is somewhat out of place; though so being, I will
here recount it.</p>

<p>Would enter, for instance, two individuals in an
oriental costume considerably damaged; one has a
cloth carefully tied round his head, the other has artificially
painted his eye and his ear with a few drops
of blood from the nose. They express their emotions
by a loud drumming of the tom-tom accompanying
the high-sounding Cri de Haro&mdash;Faryad! Faryad!
<span class="nowrap">Faryad!&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I’ll ‘Faryad’ yer, <span class="nowrap">ye”&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>After these, the usual appellatives with which the
“native” was in those days, on such occasions received,
the plaintiff is thus <span class="nowrap">addressed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Well, you&mdash;fellow! your complaint, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sahib! Oh, cherisher of the poor! this man who
is, the same hath broken into my house, and made me
eat a beating, and called my ma and sister naughty
names, and hath stolen my brass pot, and&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-218">[218]</span></p>

<p>“Bas! bas! enough!” cries the beak; “tie him”&mdash;the
defendant&mdash;“up, and give him three dozen with
thine own hand.”</p>

<p>The wrathful plaintiff, as may be imagined, is
nothing loath. After being vigorously performed upon
by the plaintiff aforesaid, the defendant is cast loose,
and is in turn addressed as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Well, now, you fellow! what say you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my lord and master! Oh, dispenser of justice!
what lies hath not this man told? What abominations
hath he not devoured? Behold (pointing to his war-paint)
the sight! He hath met me in the street; he
hath thrown me down; he hath kicked and trampled
upon me; he hath&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Bas! enough!” again cries the beak: “tie him&mdash;the
plaintiff&mdash;up, and see if you can give <i>him</i> a good
three dozen.”</p>

<p>Again it may be imagined that the three dozen
are well applied by the revengeful defendant, and that
neither that plaintiff nor that defendant ever troubled
that excellent “police-officer” again.</p>

<p>On Rubeho’s summit we found a single village of
villanous Wasagara; afterwards “made clean”&mdash;as the
mild Hindu expresses the extermination of his fellow-men&mdash;by
a caravan in revenge for the murder of a porter.
We were delayed on the hill-top a whole day, despite
the extreme discomfort of all hands. Water had to be
fetched from a runnel that issued from a rusty pool
shaded by tilted-up strata of sandstone, at least a
mile distant from camp. Rain fell daily, alternating
with eruptions of sun; a stream of thick mist rolled
down the ravines and hollows, and at night the howling
winds made Rubeho their meeting-place. Yet neither
would the sons of Ramji carry my companion’s hammock,
nor would Said bin Salim allow his children
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-219">[219]</span>
to be so burdened; moreover, whatever measures one
attempted with the porters, the other did his best to
thwart. “Men,” say the Persians, “kiss an ass for an object.”
I attempted with Kidogo that sweet speech which,
according to Orientals, is stronger than chains, and administered
“goose’s oil” in such quantities that I was
graciously permitted to make an arrangement for the
transport of my companion with the Kirangozi.</p>

<p>On the 14th September, our tempers being sensibly
cooled by the weather, we left the hill-top and broke
ground upon the counterslope or landward descent of
the Usagara Mountains. Following a narrow footpath
that wound along the hill-flanks, on red earth growing
thick clumps of cactus and feathery mimosa, after
forty-five minutes’ march we found a kraal in a swampy
green gap, bisected by a sluggish rivulet that irrigated
scanty fields of grain, gourds, and water-melons, the
property of distant villagers. For the first time since
many days I had strength enough to muster the porters
and to inspect their loads. The outfit, which was expected
to last a year, had been half exhausted in three
months. I summoned Said bin Salim, and passed on to
him my anxiety. Like a veritable Arab, he declared,
without the least emotion, that we had enough to reach
Unyanyembe, where we certainly should be joined by the
escort of twenty-two porters. “But how do you know
that?” I inquired. “Allah is all-knowing,” replied
Said; “but the caravan <i>will</i> come.” Such fatalism is
infectious. I ceased to think upon the subject.</p>

<p>On the 15th September, after sending forward the
luggage, and waiting as agreed upon for the return of
the porters to carry my companion, I set out about
noon, through hot sunshine tempered by the cool hill-breeze.
Emerging from the grassy hollow, the path
skirted a well-wooded hill and traversed a small savannah,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-220">[220]</span>
overgrown with stunted straw and hedged in by a
bushy forest. At this point massive trees, here single,
there in holts and clumps, foliaged more gloomily than
churchyard yews, and studded with delicate pink-flowers,
rose from the tawny sun-burned expanse around,
and defended from the fiery glare braky rings of emerald
shrubbery, sharply defined as if by the forester’s
hand. The savannah extended to the edge of a step
which, falling deep and steep, suddenly disclosed to
view, below and far beyond the shaggy ribs and the dark
ravines and folds of the foreground, the plateau of
Ugogo and its Eastern desert. The spectacle was
truly impressive. The vault above seemed “an ample
æther,” raised by its exceeding transparency higher
than it is wont to be. Up to the curved rim of the
western horizon, lay, burnished by the rays of a burning
sun, plains rippled like a yellow sea by the wavy
reek of the dancing air, broken towards the north by
a few detached cones rising island-like from the surface,
and zebra’d with long black lines, where bush and scrub
and strip of thorn jungle, supplanted upon the watercourses,
trending in mazy network southwards to the
Rwaha River, the scorched grass and withered canes-stubbles,
which seemed to be the staple growth of the
land. There was nothing of effeminate or luxuriant
beauty, nothing of the flush and fulness characterising
tropical Nature, in this first aspect of Ugogo. It appeared
what it is, stern and wild,&mdash;the rough nurse
of rugged men,&mdash;and perhaps the anticipation of dangers
and difficulties ever present to the minds of those
preparing to endure the waywardness of its children,
contributed not a little to the fascination of the scene.
After lingering for a few minutes upon the crest of the
step, with feelings which they will understand who
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-221">[221]</span>
after some pleasant months&mdash;oases in the grim deserts
of Anglo-Indian life&mdash;spent among the tree-clad heights,
the breezy lakes, and the turfy valleys of the Himalayas
and the Neilgherries, sight from their last vantage-ground
the jaundiced and fevered plains below, we
scrambled down an irregular incline of glaring red clay
and dazzling white chalk, plentifully besprinkled with
dark-olive silex in its cherty crust. Below the descent
was a level space upon a long ridge, where some small
villages of Wasagara had surrounded themselves with
dwarf fields of holcus, bajri, and maize. A little beyond
this spot, called the “Third Rubeho,” we found a comfortless
kraal on uneven ground, a sloping ledge sinking
towards a deep ravine.</p>

<p>At the third Rubeho we were delayed for a day&mdash;as
is customary before a “Tirikeza”&mdash;by the necessity of
laying in supplies for a jungle march, and by the
quarrels of the men. The Baloch were cross as naughty
children, ever their case when cold and hungry: warm
and full, they become merry as crickets. The Kirangozi
in hot wrath brought his flag to Said bin
Salim, and threatened to resign, because he had been
preceded on the last stage by two of the Baloch: his
complaints of this highly irregular proceeding were
with difficulty silenced by force of beads. I remarked,
however, a few days afterwards, when travelling through
Ugogo, that the Kirangozi, considering himself in
danger, applied to me for a vanguard of matchlockmen.
The sons of Ramji combined with the porters in refusing
to carry my companion, and had Bombay and
Mabruki not shown good-will, we might have remained
a week in the acme of discomfort. The asses,
frightened by wild beasts, broke loose at night, and one
was lost. The atmosphere was ever in excesses of heat
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-222">[222]</span>
and cold: in the morning, a mist so thick that it displayed
a fog-rainbow&mdash;a segment of an arch, composed
of faint prismatic tints&mdash;rolled like a torrent down the
ravine in front: the sun, at noon, made us cower
under the thin canvas, and throughout the twenty-four
hours a gale like a “vent de bise,” attracted by the
heat of the western plains, swept the encamping ground.</p>

<p>Sending forward my invalid companion in his hammock,
I brought up the rear: Said bin Salim, who had
waxed unusually selfish and surly, furtively left to us
the task; he wore only sandals&mdash;he could not travel by
night. Some of the Baloch wept at the necessity of
carrying their gourds and skins.</p>

<p>On the 17th September, about 2 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, we resumed the
descent of the rugged mountains. The path wound
to the N.W. down the stony and bushy crest of a ridge
with a deep woody gap on the right hand: presently after
alternations of steep and step, and platforms patched
with odoriferous plants, it fell into the upper channel
of the Mandama or the Dungomaro, the “Devil’s Glen.”
Dungomaro in Kisawahili is the proper name of an evil
spirit, not in the European but in the African sense,&mdash;some
unblessed ghost who has made himself unpopular
to the general;&mdash;perhaps the term was a facetiousness
on the part of the sons of Ramji.</p>

<p>It was a “via mala” down this great surface-drain of
the western slopes, over boulders and water-rolled stones
reposing upon deep sand, and with branches of thorny
trees in places canopying the bed. After a march of
five hours, I found the porters bivouacking upon a
softer spot, and with difficulty persuaded four of the
sons of Ramji to return and to assist the weary
stragglers: horns were sounded, and shots were fired
to guide the Baloch, who did not, however, arrive before
10 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-223">[223]</span></p>

<p>On the 18th September, a final march of four hours
placed us in the plains of Ugogo. Leaving the place of
the last night’s bivouac, we pursued the line of the Dungomaro,
occasionally quitting it where boulders obstructed
progress, and presently we came to its lower
bed, where perennial rills, exuding from its earth-walls
and trickling down its side, veiled the bottom with a green
and shrubby perfumed vegetation. As the plain was
neared, the difficulties increased, and the scenery became
curious. The Dungomaro appeared a large crevasse in
lofty rocks of pink and gray granite, streaked with
white quartz, and pudding’d with greenstone and black
horneblend; the sole, strewed with a rugged layer of
blocks, was side-lined with narrow ledges and terraces
of brown humus, supporting dwarf cactus and stunted
thorny trees; whilst high above towered stony wooded
peaks, closing in the view on all sides. Farther down the
bed huge boulders, sunburnt, and stained by the courses
of rain-torrents, rose, perpendicularly as walls, to the
height of one hundred and one hundred and twenty feet,
and there the flooring was a sheet or slide of shiny and
shelving rock, with broad fissures, and steep drops, and
cups, “potholes,” baths, and basins, filed and cut by the
friction of the gravelly torrents, regularly as if turned
with the lathe. Where water lay, deep mud and thick
clumps of grass and reed forced the path to run along
the ledges at the sides of the base. Gradually, as the
angle of inclination became more obtuse, the bed
widened out, the tall stone-walls gave way to low earth-banks
clad with gum-trees; pits, serving as wells, appeared
in the deep loose sand, and the Dungomaro, becoming a
broad, smooth Fiumara, swept away verging southwards
into the plain. Before noon, I sighted from a sharp turn
in the bed our tent pitched under a huge sycomore, on a
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-224">[224]</span>
level step that bounded the Fiumara to the right. It
was a pretty spot in a barren scene, grassy, and grown
with green mimosas, spreading out their feathery heads
like parachutes, and shedding upon the ground a filmy
shade that fluttered and flickered in the draughty
breeze.</p>

<p>The only losses experienced during the scrambling
descent, were a gun-case, containing my companion’s
store of boots, and a chair and table. The latter, being
indispensable on a journey where calculations, composition,
and sketching were expected, I sent, during the
evening halts, a detachment consisting of Muinyi Wazira,
the Baloch, Greybeard Musa, and a party of slaves, to
bring up the articles, which had been cache’d on the
torrent bank. They returned with the horripilatory tale
of the dangers lately incurred by the Expedition, which
it appeared from them had been dogged by an army of
Wasagara, thirsting for blood and furious for booty:&mdash;under
such circumstances, how could they recover the
chair and table? Some months afterwards an up-caravan
commanded by a Msawahili found the articles lying
where we had left them, and delivered them, for a consideration,
to us at Unyanyembe. The party sent from
Ugogo doubtless had passed a quiet, pleasant day, dozing
in the shade at the nearest well.</p>

<span class="chapname">THE GEOGRAPHY AND ETHNOLOGY OF THE SECOND REGION.</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="noindent">The second or mountain region extends from the western
frontier of K’hutu, at the head of the alluvial valley,
in E. long. 37° 28′, to the province of Ugogi, the eastern
portion of the flat table-land of Ugogo, in E. long. 36°
14′. Its diagonal breadth is 85 geographical and rectilinear
miles; and native caravans, if lightly laden, generally
traverse it in three weeks, including three or four
halts. Its length cannot be estimated. According to the
guides, Usagara is a prolongation of the mountains of
Nguru, or Ngu, extending southwards, with a gap forming
the fluviatile valley of the Rwaha or Rufiji River, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-226">[226]</span>
the line of highlands of which Njesa in Uhiao is supposed
to be the culminating apex: thus the feature would
correspond with the Eastern Ghauts of the Indian Peninsula.
The general law of the range is north and
south; in the region now under consideration, the trend
is from north by west to south by east, forming an angle
of 10° 12′ with the meridian. The Usagara chain is
of the first order in East Africa; it is indeed the
only important elevation in a direct line from the coast
to western Unyamwezi; it would hold, however, but
a low grade in the general system of the earth’s mountains.
The highest point above sea-level, observed by B.
P. Therm., was 5,700 feet; there are, however, peaks
which may rise to 6,000 and even to 7,000 feet, thus rivalling
the inhabited portion of the Neilgherries. As has
appeared, the chain, where crossed, was divided into
three parallel ridges by longitudinal plains.</p>

<p>Owing to the lowness of the basal regions at the seaward
slope, there is no general prospect of the mountains
from the East, where, after bounding the plains
of K’hutu on the north, by irregular bulging lines of rolling
hill, the first gradient of insignificant height springs
suddenly from the plain. Viewed from the west, the
counterslope appears a long crescent, with the gibbus to
the front, and the cusps vanishing into distance; the
summit is in the centre of the half-moon, whose profile
is somewhat mural and regular. The flanks are
rounded lumpy cones, and their shape denotes an igneous
and primary origin, intersected by plains and basins, the
fractures of the rocky system. Internally the lay, as
in granitic formations generally, is irregular; the ridges,
preserving no general direction, appear to cross one
another confusedly. The slope and the counterslope
are not equally inclined. Here, as usual in chains fringing
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-227">[227]</span>
a peninsula, the seaward declivities are the more
abrupt; the landward faces are not only more elongated,
but they are also shortened in proportion as the plateau
into which they fall is higher than the mountain-plains
from which they rise. To enter, therefore, is more toilsome
than to return.</p>

<p>From the mingling of lively colours, Usagara is delightful
to the eye, after the monotonous tracts of verdure
which pall upon the sight at Zanzibar and in the
river valleys. The subsoil, displayed in the deeper cuts
and ravines, is either of granite, greenstone, schiste, or a
coarse incipient sandstone, brown or green, and outcropping
from the ground with strata steeply tilted up. In
the higher elevations, the soil varies in depth from a
few inches to thirty feet; it is often streaked with long
layers of pebbles, apparently water-rolled. The colour
is either an ochreish brick-red, sometimes micaceous, and
often tinted with oxide of iron; or it is a dull grey,
the debris of comminuted felspar, which, like a mixture of
all the colours, appears dazzlingly white under the sun’s
rays. The plains and depressions are of black earth,
which after a few showers becomes a grass-grown sheet
of mire, and in the dry season a deeply-cracked, stubbly
savannah. Where the elevations are veiled from base
to summit with a thin forest, the crops of the greenstone
and sandstone strata appear through a brown coat
of fertile humus, the decay of vegetable matter. A fossil
Bulimus was found about 3,000 feet above sea-level,
and large Achatinæ, locally called Khowa, are scattered
over the surface. On the hill-sides, especially in the
lower slopes, are strewed and scattered erratic blocks and
boulders, and diminutive pieces of white, dingy-red, rusty-pink,
and yellow quartz, with large irregularly-shaped
fragments and small nodules of calcareous kunkur. Where
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-228">[228]</span>
water lies deep below the surface, the hills and hill-plains
are clothed with a thin shrubbery of mimosas and other
thorny gums. Throughout Eastern Africa these forests
are the only spots in which travelling is enjoyable: great
indeed is their contrast with the normal features&mdash;bald
glaring fields, fetid bush and grass, and monotonous
expanses of dull dead herbage, concealing swamps and
water-courses, hedged in by vegetation whose only
varieties are green, greener, and greenest. In these favoured
places the traveller appears surrounded by a thick
wood which he never reaches, the trees thinning out as
he advances. On clear and sunny days the scenery is
strange and imposing. The dark-red earth is prolonged
half-way up the tree-trunks by the ascending
and descending galleries of the termite: contrasting
with this peculiarly African tint, the foliage, mostly
confined to the upper branches, is of a tender and
lively green, whose open fret-work admits from above the
vivid blue or the golden yellow of an unclouded sky.
In the basins where water is nearer the surface, and
upon the banks of water-courses and rivulets, the sweet
and fertile earth produces a rich vegetation, and a
gigantic growth of timber, which distinguishes this
region from others further west. Usagara is peculiarly
the land of jungle-flowers, and fruits, whose characteristic
is a pleasant acidity, a provision of nature
in climates where antiseptics and correctives to bile
are almost necessaries of life. They are abundant,
but, being uncultivated, the fleshy parts are undeveloped.
In the plains, the air, heavy with the delicious
perfume of the jasmine (<i>Jasminum Abyssinicum?</i>),
with the strong odour of a kind of sage (<i>Salvia Africana</i>,
or <i>Abyssinica</i>?), and with the fragrant exhalations
of the mimosa-flowers, which hang like golden balls from
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-229">[229]</span>
the green clad boughs, forms a most enjoyable contrast
to the fetid exhalations of the Great Dismal Swamps
of the lowlands. The tamarind, everywhere growing
wild, is a gigantic tree. The Myombo, the Mfu’u, the
Ndábi, and the Mayágeá, a spreading tree with a large
fleshy red flower, and gourds about eighteen inches long
and hanging by slender cords, are of unusual dimensions;
the calabash is converted into a hut; and the sycomore,
whose favourite habitat is the lower counterslope of Usagara,
is capable of shading a regiment. On the steep
hill-sides, which here and there display signs of cultivation
and clearings of green or sunburnt grass, grow parachute-shaped
mimosas, with tall and slender trunks, and
crowned by domes of verdure, rising in tiers one above
the other, like umbrellas in a crowd.</p>

<p>The plains, basins, and steps, or facets of table-land
found at every elevation, are fertilised by a stripe-work
of streams, runnels, and burns, which anastomosing in
a single channel, flow off into the main drain of the
country. Cultivation is found in patches isolated by
thick belts of thorny jungle, and the villages are few
and rarely visited. As usual in hilly countries, they
are built upon high ridges and the slopes of cones, for
rapid drainage after rain, a purer air and fewer mosquitoes,
and, perhaps, protection from kidnappers. The
country people bring down their supplies of grain and
pulse for caravans. There is some delay and difficulty
on the first day of arrival at a station, and provisions
for a party exceeding a hundred men are not to be
depended upon after the third or fourth marketing,
when the people have exhausted their stores. Fearing
the thievish disposition of the Wasagara, who will
attempt even to snatch away a cloth from a sleeping
man, travellers rarely lodge near the settlements.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-230">[230]</span>
Kraals of thorn, capacious circles enclosing straw
boothies, are found at every march, and, when burned
or destroyed by accident, they are rebuilt before
the bivouac. The roads, as usual in East Africa, are
tracks trodden down by caravans and cattle, and the
water-course is ever the favourite Pass. Many of the
ascents and descents are so proclivitous that donkeys
must be relieved of their loads; and in fording the sluggish
streams, where no grass forms a causeway over the
soft, viscid mire, the animals sink almost to the knees.
The steepest paths are those in the upper regions; in the
lower, though the inclines are often severe, they are
generally longer, and consequently easier. At the foot
of each hill there is either a mud or a water-course
dividing it from its neighbour. These obstacles greatly
reduce the direct distance of the day’s march.</p>

<p>The mountains are well supplied with water, which tastes
sweet after the brackish produce of the maritime valley,
and good when not rendered soft and slimy by lying
long on rushy beds. Upon the middle inclines the
burns and runnels of the upper heights form terraces
of considerable extent, and of a picturesque aspect.
The wide and open sole, filled with the whitest and
cleanest sand, and retaining pools of fresh clear water,
or shallow wells, is edged by low steep ledges of
a dull red clay, lined with glorious patriarchs of the
forest, and often in the bed is a thickly wooded branch
or shoal-islet, at whose upper extremity heavy driftwood,
arrested by the gnarled mimosa-clumps, and the
wall of shrubs, attests the violence of the rufous-tinted
bore of waves with which a few showers fill the broadest
courses. Lower down the channels which convey to
the plains the surplus drainage of the mountains are
heaps and sheets of granite, with long reaches of rough
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-231">[231]</span>
gravel; their stony walls, overrun with vegetation,
tower high on either hand, and the excess of inclination
produces after heavy rains torrents like avalanches,
which cut their way deep into the lower plains. During
the dry season, water is drawn from pits sunk from a
few inches to 20 feet in the re-entering angles of the
beds. Fed by the percolations of the soil, they unite
the purity of springs with the abundance of rain-supplies,&mdash;a
comfort fully appreciated by down-caravans
after the frequent tirikeza, or droughty afternoon-marches
in the western regions.</p>

<p>The versant of the mountains varies. In the seaward
and the central sections streams flow eastward,
and swell the Kingani and other rivers. The southern
hills discharge their waters south and south-west through
the Maroro River, and various smaller tributaries, into the
“Rwaha,” which is the proper name for the upper course
of the Rufiji. In the lateral plains between the ridges,
and in the hill-girt basins, stagnant pools, which even
during the Masika, or rainy season, inundate, but will
not flow, repose upon beds of porous black earth, and
engendering, by their profuse herbage of reeds and
rush-like grass, with the luxuriant crops produced by
artificial irrigation, a malarious atmosphere, cause a
degradation in the people.</p>

<p>The climate of Usagara is cold and damp. It has
two distinct varieties, the upper regions being salubrious,
as the lower are unwholesome. In the sub-ranges
heavy exhalations are emitted by the decayed
vegetation, the nights are raw, the mornings chilly and
misty, and the days are bright and hot. In the higher
levels, near the sources of the Mukondokwa River, the
climate suggests the idea of the Mahabaleshwar and the
Neilgherry Hills in Western India. Compared with
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-232">[232]</span>
Uzaramo or Unyamwezi, these mountains are a sanatorium,
and should Europeans ever settle in Eastern Africa
as merchants or missionaries, here they might reside
until acclimatised for the interior. The east wind, a
local deflection of the south-east trade, laden with the
moisture of the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans, and
collecting the evaporation of the valley, impinges upon
the seaward slope, where, ascending, and relieved from
atmospheric pressure, it is condensed by a colder temperature;
hence the frequent precipitations of heavy rain,
and the banks and sheets of morning-cloud which veil
the tree-clad peaks of the highest gradients. As the
sun waxes hot, the atmosphere acquires a greater
capacity for carrying water; and the results are a milky
mist in the basins, and in the upper hills a wonderful
clearness broken only by the thin cirri of the higher
atmosphere. After sunset, again, the gradual cooling
of the air causes the deposit of a copious dew, which
renders the nights peculiarly pleasant to a European.
The diurnal sea-breeze, felt in the slope, is unknown
in the counterslope of the mountains, where, indeed,
the climate is much inferior to that of the central
and eastern heights. As in the Sawalik Hills, and
the sub-ranges of the Himalayas, the sun is burning hot
during the dry season, and in the rains there is either a
storm of thunder and lightning, wind and rain, or a
stillness deep and depressing, with occasional gusts whose
distinct moaning shows the highly electrical state of the
atmosphere. The Masika, here commencing in early
January, lasts three months, when the normal easterly
winds shift to the north and the north-west. The Vuli,
confined to the eastern slopes, occurs in August, and, as
on the plains, frequent showers fall between the vernal
and the autumnal rains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-233">[233]</span></p>

<p>The people of Usagara suffer in the lower regions from
severe ulcerations, from cutaneous disorders, and from
other ailments of the plain. Higher up they are healthier,
though by no means free from pleurisy, pneumonia, and
dysentery. Fever is common; it is more acute in the
range of swamps and decomposed herbage, and is milder
in the well-ventilated cols and on the hill-sides. The type
is rather a violent bilious attack, accompanied by remittent
febrile symptoms, than a regular fever. It begins
with cold and hot fits, followed by a copious perspiration,
and sometimes inducing delirium; it lasts as a
quotidian or a tertian from four to seven days; and
though the attacks are slight, they are followed by great
debility, want of appetite, of sleep, and of energy. This
fever is greatly exacerbated by exposure and fatigue,
and it seldom fails to leave behind it a legacy of cerebral
or visceral disease.</p>

<p>The mountains of Usagara are traversed from east to
west by two main lines; the Mukondokwa on the northern
and the Kiringawana on the southern line. The
former was closed until 1856 by a chronic famine, the
result of such a neighbourhood as the Wazegura and the
people of Whinde on the east, the Wahumba and the
Wamasai northwards, and the Warori on the south-west.
In 1858 the mountaineers, after murdering by the vilest
treachery a young Arab trader, Salim bin Nasir, of the
Bu Saidi, or the royal family of Zanzibar, attempted to
plunder a large mixed caravan of Wanyamwezi and
Wasawahili, numbering 700 or 800 guns, commanded
by a stout fellow, Abdullah bin Nasib, called by the
Africans “Kisesa,” who carried off the cattle, burned the
villages, and laid waste the whole of the Rubeho or
western chain.</p>

<p>The clans now tenanting these East African ghauts are
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-234">[234]</span>
the Wasagara,&mdash;with their chief sub-tribe the Wakwivi,&mdash;and
the Wahehe; the latter a small body inhabiting
the south-western corner, and extending into the plains
below.</p>

<p>The limits of the Wasagara have already been laid
down by the names of the plundering tribes that surround
them. These mountaineers, though a noisy and
riotous race, are not overblessed with courage: they
will lurk in the jungle with bows and arrows to surprise
a stray porter; but they seem ever to be awaiting an
attack&mdash;the best receipt for inviting it. In the higher
slopes they are fine, tall and sturdy men; in the low
lands they appear as degraded as the Wak’hutu. They
are a more bearded race than any other upon this line
of East Africa, and, probably from extensive intercourse
with the Wamrima, most of them understand
the language of the coast. The women are remarkable
for a splendid development of limb, whilst the bosom is
lax and pendent.</p>

<p>The Wasagara display great varieties of complexion,
some being almost black, whilst the others are chocolate-coloured.
This difference cannot be accounted for by the
mere effects of climate&mdash;level and temperature. Some
shave the head; others wear the Arab’s shushah, a kind of
skull-cap growth, extending more or less from the poll.
Amongst them is seen, for the first time on this line, the
classical coiffure of ancient Egypt. The hair, allowed to
attain its fullest length, is twisted into a multitude of
the thinnest ringlets, each composed of two thin lengths
wound together; the wiry stiffness of the curls keeps
them distinct and in position. Behind, a curtain of
pigtails hangs down to the nape; in front the hair is
either combed off the forehead, or it is brought over
the brow and trimmed short. No head-dress has a
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-235">[235]</span>
wilder nor a more characteristically African appearance
than this, especially when, smeared with a pomatum of
micaceous ochre, and decorated with beads, brass balls,
and similar ornaments, it waves and rattles with every
motion of the head. Young men and warriors adorn
their locks with the feathers of vultures, ostriches, and
a variety of bright-plumed jays, and some tribes twist
each ringlet with a string of reddish fibre. It is seldom
combed out, the operation requiring for a head of thick
hair the hard work of a whole day; it is not, therefore,
surprising that the pediculus swarms through the land.
None but the chiefs wear caps. Both sexes distend the
ear-lobe; a hole is bored with a needle or a thorn, it
is enlarged by inserting bits of cane, wood, or quills,
increasing the latter to the number of twenty, and it is
kept open by a disk of brass, ivory, wood, or gum, a
roll of leaf or a betel-nut; thus deformed it serves for a
variety of purposes apparently foreign to the member;
it often carries a cane snuff-box, sometimes a goat’s-horn
pierced for a fife, and other small valuables.
When empty, especially in old age, it depends in a deformed
loop to the shoulders. The peculiar mark of
the tribe is a number of confused little cuts between the
ears and the eyebrows. Some men, especially in the
eastern parts of the mountains, chip the teeth to
points.</p>

<p>The dress of the Wasagara is a shukkah or loin-cloth,
6 feet long, passed round the waist in a single fold,&mdash;otherwise
walking would be difficult&mdash;drawn tight
behind, and with the fore extremities gathered up, and
tucked in over the stomach, where it is sometimes supported
by a girdle of cord, leather, or brass wire: it is,
in fact, the Arab’s “uzár.” On journeys it is purposely
made short and scanty for convenience of running.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-236">[236]</span>
The material is sometimes indigo-dyed, at other
times unbleached cotton, which the Wasagara stain a
dull yellow. Cloth, however, is the clothing of the
wealthy. The poor content themselves with the calabash-“campestre”
or kilt, and with the softened skins of sheep
and goats. It is curious that in East Africa, where
these articles have from time immemorial been the
national dress, and where amongst some tribes hides
form the house, that the people have neither invented
nor borrowed the principles of rude tanning, even with
mimosa-bark, an art so well known to most tribes of
barbarians. Immediately after flaying, the stretched
skin is pegged, to prevent shrinking, inside upwards, in
the sun, and it is not removed till thoroughly cleansed
and dried. The many little holes in the margin give it
the semblance of ornamentation, and sometimes the hair
is scraped off, leaving a fringe two or three inches broad
around the edge: the legs and tail of the animal are
favourite appendages with “dressy gentlemen.” These
skins are afterwards softened by trampling, and they
are vigorously pounded with clubs: after a few days’
wear, dirt and grease have almost done the duty of
tanning. The garb is tied over either shoulder by a bit
of cord or simply by knotting the corners; it therefore
leaves one side of the body bare, and, being loose and
ungirt, it is at the mercy of every wind. On journeys
it is doffed during rain, and placed between the burden
and the shoulder, so that, arrived at the encamping
ground, the delicate traveller may have a “dry shirt.”</p>

<p>Women of the wealthier classes wear a tobe, or
double-length shukkah, tightly drawn under the arms,
so as to depress whilst it veils the bosom, and tucked in
at either side. Dark stuffs, indigo-dyed and Arab checks,
are preferred to plain white for the usual reasons. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-237">[237]</span>
dress of the general is a short but decorous jupe of
greasy skin, and a similar covering for the bosom, open
behind, and extending in front from the neck to the
middle of the body: the child is carried in another
skin upon the back. The poorest classes of both sexes
are indifferently attired in the narrow kilt of bark-fibre,
usually made in the maritime countries from
the ukhindu or brab tree; in the interior from
the calabash. The children wear an apron of thin
twine, like the Nubian thong-garments. Where beads
abound, the shagele, a small square napkin of these
ornaments strung upon thread, is fastened round
the waist by a string or a line of beads. There are
many fanciful modifications of it: some children wear
a screen of tin plates, each the size of a man’s finger:
most of the very juniors, however, are simply attired in
a cord, with or without beads, round the waist.</p>

<p>The ornaments of the Wasagara are the normal beads
and wire, and their weight is the test of wealth and respectability.
A fillet of blue and white beads is bound
round the head, and beads,&mdash;more beads,&mdash;appear
upon the neck, the arms, and the ankles. The kitindi,
or coil of thick brass wire, extends from the elbow to
the wrist; others wear little chains or thick bangles of
copper, brass, or zinc, and those who can afford it twist
a few circles of brass wire under the knee. The arms of
the men are bows and arrows, the latter unpoisoned, but
armed with cruelly-barbed heads, and spines like fish-bones,
cut out in the long iron shaft which projects
from the wood. Their spears and assegais are made
from the old hoes which are brought down by the
Wanyamwezi caravans; the ferule is thin, and it is
attached to the shaft by a cylinder of leather from a
cow’s tail, drawn over the iron, and allowed to shrink
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-238">[238]</span>
at its junction with the wood: some assegais have a
central swell in the shaft, probably to admit of their
being used in striking like the rungu or knobstick. Men
seldom leave the house without a billhook of peculiar
shape&mdash;a narrow sharp blade, ending in a right angle, and
fixed in a wooden handle, with a projection rising above
the blade. The shield is rarely found on this line of East
Africa. In Usagara it is from three to four feet in
length by one to two feet in breadth, composed of two
parallel belts of hardened skin. The material is pegged
out to stretch and dry, carefully cleaned, sometimes
doubled, sewn together with a thin thong longitudinally,
and stained black down one side, and red down the
other. A stout lath is fastened lengthwise as a stiffener
to the shield, and a central bulge is made in the
hide, enabling the hand to grasp the wood. The favourite
materials are the spoils of the elephant, the
rhinoceros, and the giraffe; the common shields are of
bull’s-hide, and the hair is generally left upon the outside
as an ornament, with attachments of zebra and
cows’ tails. It is a flimsy article, little better than a
“wisp of fern or a herring-net” against an English
“clothyard:” it suffices, however, for defence against
the puny cane-arrows of the African archer.</p>

<p>As a rule, each of these villages has its headman, who
owns, however, an imperfect allegiance to the Mutwa or
district chief, whom the Arabs call “sultan.” The Mgosi
is his wazir, or favourite councillor, and the elders or
headmen of settlements collectively are Wabáhá. Their
principal distinction is the right to wear a fez, or a
Surat cap, and the kizbáo, a sleeveless waistcoat. They
derive a certain amount of revenue by trafficking in
slaves: consequently many of the Wasagara find their
way into the market of Zanzibar. Moreover, the game-laws
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-239">[239]</span>
as regards elephants are here strictly in favour of
the Sultan. An animal found dead in his district,
though wounded in another, becomes his property on
condition of his satisfying his officials with small presents
of cloth and beads: the flesh is feasted upon by the
tribe, and the ivory is sold to travelling traders.</p>

<p>The Wahehe, situated between the Wasagara and
Wagogo, partake a little of the appearance of both.
They are a plain race, but stout and well grown. Though
to appearance hearty and good-humoured, they are determined
pilferers: they have more than once attacked
caravans, and only the Warori have prevented them from
cutting off the road to Ugogo. During the return
of the Expedition in 1858 they took occasion to
drive off unseen a flock of goats; and at night no
man, unless encamped in a strong kraal, was safe from
their attempts to snatch his goods. On one occasion,
being caught in flagrant delict, they were compelled to
restore their plunder, with an equivalent as an indemnity.
They are on bad terms with all their neighbours,
and they unite under their chief Sultan Bumbumu.</p>

<p>The Wahehe enlarge their ears like the Wagogo, they
chip the two upper incisors, and they burn beauty-spots
in their forearms. Some men extract three or four of
the lower incisors: whenever an individual without these
teeth is seen in Ugogo he is at once known as a Mhehe.
For distinctive mark they make two cicatrised incisions
on both cheeks from the zygomata to the angles of
the mouth. They dress like the Wagogo, but they
have less cloth than skins. The married women usually
wear a jupe, in shape recalling the old swallow-tailed
coat of Europe, with kitindi, or coil armlets of brass or
iron wire on both forearms and above the elbows. Unmarried
girls amongst the Wahehe are known by their
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-240">[240]</span>
peculiar attire, a long strip of cloth, like the Indian
“languti or T-bandage,” but descending to the knees,
and attached to waistbelts of large white or yellow porcelain
or blue glass beads. Over this is tied a kilt of
calabash fibre, a few inches deep. The men wear thick
girdles of brass wire, neatly wound round a small cord.
Besides the arms described amongst the Wasagara, the
Wahehe carry “sime,” or double-edged knives, from
one to two feet long, broadening out from the haft, and
rounded off to a blunt point at the end. The handle
is cut into raised rings for security of grip, and, when
in sheath, half the blade appears outside its rude
leathern scabbard. The Tembe, or villages of the
Wahehe, are small, ragged, and low, probably to facilitate
escape from attack. They do business in slaves,
and have large flocks and herds, which are, however,
often thinned by the Warori, whom the Wahehe dare
not resist in the field.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="noindent">Ugogo, the reader may remember, was the ultimate
period applied to the prospects of the Exploration
by the worthy Mr. Rush Ramji, in conversation with
the respectable Ladha Damha, Collector of Customs,
Zanzibar.</p>

<p>I halted three days at Ugogi to recruit the party and
to lay in rations for four long desert marches. Apparently
there was an abundance of provisions, but the
people at first declined to part with their grain and cattle
even at exorbitant prices, and the Baloch complained
of “cleanness of teeth.” I was visited by Ngoma Mroma,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-242">[242]</span>
<i>alias</i> Sultan Makande, a diwan or headman, from Ugogo,
here settled as chief, and well known on the eastern seaboard:
he came to offer his good services. But he talked
like an idiot, he begged for every article that met his
eye: and he wished me&mdash;palpably for his own benefit&mdash;to
follow the most northerly of the three routes leading
to Unyamwezi, upon which there were not less than eight
“sultans” described by Kidogo as being “one hungrier
than the other.” At last, an elephant having been found
dead within his limits, he disappeared, much to my
relief, for the purpose of enjoying a gorge of elephant-beef.</p>

<p>Ugogi is the half-way district between the coast and
Unyanyembe, and it is usually made by up-caravans
at the end of the second month. The people of this
“no man’s land” are a mongrel race: the Wasagara
claim the ground, but they have admitted as settlers
many Wahehe and Wagogo, the latter for the most part
men who have left their country for their country’s good.
The plains are rich in grain, and the hills in cattle, when
not harried, as they had been, a little before our arrival,
by the Warori. The inhabitants sometimes offer for sale
milk and honey, eggs and ghee, but&mdash;only the civilised
rogue can improve by adulteration&mdash;the milk falls like
water off the finger, the honey is in the red stage of fermentation,
of the eggs there are few without the rude beginnings
of a chicken, and the ghee, from long keeping,
is sweet above and bitter below. The country still contains
game, kanga, or guinea-fowls, in abundance, the
ocelot, a hyrax like the coney of the Somali country,
and the beautiful “silver jackal.” The elephant and
the giraffe are frequently killed on the plains. The giraffe
is called by the Arabs Jamal el Wahshí, a translation of
the Kisawahili Ngamia ya Muytu, “Camel of the Wild,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-243">[243]</span>
and throughout the interior Tiga or Twiga. Their sign
is often seen in the uncultivated parts of the country;
but they wander far, and they are rarely found except by
accident; the hides are converted into shields and
saddle-bags, the long tufty tails into “chauri,” or fly-flappers,
and the flesh is a favourite food. At Ugogi,
however, game has suffered from the frequent haltings
of caravans, and from the carnivorous propensities of the
people, who, huntsmen all, leave their prey no chance
against their nets and arrows, their pitfalls and their
packs of yelping curs.</p>

<p>Ugogi stands 2760 feet above sea level, and its climate,
immediately after the raw cold of Usagara, pleases by its
elasticity and by its dry healthy warmth. The nights
are fresh and dewless, and the rays of a tropical sun are
cooled by the gusts and raffales which, regularly as the
land and sea-breezes of the coast, sweep down the sinuosities
of Dungomaro. As our “gnawing stomachs” testified,
the air of Usagara had braced our systems. My
companion so far recovered health that he was able to bring
home many a brace of fine partridge, and of the fat guinea-fowl
that, clustering upon the tall trees, awoke the echoes
of the rocks as they called for their young. The Baloch,
the sons of Ramji, and the porters began to throw off the
effects of the pleurisies and the other complaints, which
they attributed to hardship and exposure on the mountain-tops.
The only obstinate invalids were the two Goanese.
Gaetano had another attack of the Mukunguru, or seasoning
fever, which, instead of acclimatising his constitution,
seemed by ever increasing weakness and depression,
to pave the way for a fresh visitation. Valentine,
with flowing eyes, pathetically pointed to two indurations
in his gastric region, and bewailed his hard fate in thus
being torn from the dearly-loved shades of Panjim
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-244">[244]</span>
and Margão, to fatten the inhospitable soil of Central
Africa.</p>

<p>Immediately before departure, when almost in despair
at the rapid failure of our carriage&mdash;the asses were now
reduced to nine&mdash;I fortunately secured, for the sum of
four cloths per man, the services of fifteen Wanyamwezi
porters. In all a score, they had left at Ugogi their
Mtongi, or employer, in consequence of a quarrel concerning
<i>the</i> sex. They dreaded forcible seizure and sale
if found without protection travelling homewards
through Ugogo; and thus they willingly agreed to carry
our goods as far as their own country, Unyanyembe.
Truly is travelling like campaigning,&mdash;a pennyweight
of luck is better than a talent of all the
talents! And if marriages, as our fathers used to say,
are made in the heavens, the next-door manufactory
must be devoted to the fabrication of African explorations.
Notwithstanding, however, the large increase of
conveyance, every man appeared on the next march
more heavily laden than before:&mdash;they carried grain
for six days, and water for one night.</p>

<p>From Ugogi to the Ziwa or Pond, the eastern limits
of Ugogo, are four marches, which, as they do not supply
provisions, and as throughout the dry season water is
found only in one spot, are generally accomplished in
four days. The lesser desert, between Ugogi and Ugogo,
is called Marenga M’khali, or the Brackish Water: it
must not be confounded with the district of Usagara
bearing the same name.</p>

<p>We left Ugogi on the 22nd September, at 3 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, instead
of at noon. As all the caravan hurried recklessly
forward, I brought up the rear accompanied by Said bin
Salim, the Jemadar, and several of the sons of Ramji,
who insisted upon driving the asses for greater speed at
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-245">[245]</span>
a long trot, which, after lasting a hundred yards, led to
an inevitable fall of the load. Before emerging from
Ugogi, the road wound over a grassy country, thickly
speckled with calabashes. Square Tembe appeared on
both sides, and there was no want of flocks and herds.
As the villages and fields were left behind, the land became
a dense thorny jungle, based upon a sandy red soil.
The horizon was bounded on both sides by gradually-thinning
lines of lumpy outlying hill, the spurs of the
Rubeho Range, that extended, like a scorpion’s claws,
westward; and the plain, gently falling in the same
direction, was broken only by a single hill-shoulder
and by some dwarf descents. As we advanced through
the shades&mdash;a heavy cloud-bank had shut out the
crescent moon&mdash;our difficulties increased; thorns and
spiky twigs threatened the eyes; the rough and rugged
road led to many a stumble, and the frequent whine of
the cynhyæna made the asses wild with fear. None but
Bombay came out to meet us; the porters were overpowered
by their long march under the fiery sun. About
8 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, directed by loud shouts and flaring fires, we
reached a kraal, a patch of yellow grass, offering clear
room in the thorny thicket. That night was the perfection
of a bivouac, cool from the vicinity of the hills,
genial from their shelter, and sweet as forest-air in
these regions ever is.</p>

<p>On the next day we resumed our labour betimes:
for a dreary and thirsty stage lay before us. Toiling
through the sunshine of the hot waste I could not but
remark the strange painting of the land around. At
a distance the plain was bright-yellow with stubble,
and brown-black with patches of leafless wintry jungle
based upon a brick-dust soil. A closer approach disclosed
colours more vivid and distinct. Over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-246">[246]</span>
ruddy plain lay scattered untidy heaps of grey granite
boulders, surrounded and capped by tufts of bleached
white grass. The copse showed all manner of strange
hues, calabashes purpled and burnished by sun and rain,
thorns of a greenish coppery bronze, dead trees with
trunks of ghastly white, and gums (the blue-gum tree
of the Cape?) of an unnatural sky-blue, the effect of the
yellow outer pellicle being peeled off by the burning
rays, whilst almost all were reddened up to a man’s
height, by the double galleries, ascending and descending,
of the white ants. Here too, I began to appreciate the
extent of the nuisance, thorns. Some were soft and green,
others a finger long, fine, straight and woody&mdash;they serve
as needles in many parts of the country&mdash;one, a “corking
pin,” bore at its base a filbert-like bulge, another was
curved like a cock’s spur; the double thorns, placed dos-à-dos,
described by travellers in Abyssinia and in the Cape
Karroos, were numerous, the “wait-a-bit,” a dwarf
sharply bent spine with acute point and stout foundation,
and a smaller variety, short and deeply crooked,
numerous and tenacious as fish-hooks, tore without
difficulty the strongest clothing, even our woollen
Arab “Abas,” and our bed-covers of painted canvas.</p>

<p>Travelling through this broom-jungle and crossing
grassy plains, over paths where the slides of elephants’
feet upon the last year’s muddy clay showed that the
land was not always dry, we halted after 11 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> for about
an hour at the base of a steep incline, apparently an offset
from the now distant Rubeho Range. The porters
would have nighted at the mouth of a small drain
which, too steep for ascent, exposed in its rocky bed
occasional sand-patches and deep pools; Kidogo, however,
forced them forwards, declaring that if the asses
drank of this “brackish water,” they would sicken and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-247">[247]</span>
die. His assertion, suspected of being a “traveller’s
tale,” was subsequently confirmed by the Arabs of
Unyanyembe, who declared that the country people
never water their flocks and herds below the hill; there
may be poisonous vegetation in the few yards between
the upper and the lower pools, but no one offered any
explanation of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Ascending with difficulty the eastern face of the
step, which presented two ladders of loose stones and
fixed boulders of grey syenite, hornblende, and greenstone,
with coloured quartzes, micacious schistes, and layers of
talcose slate glittering like mother-o’-pearl upon the
surface, we found a half-way platform some 150 feet of
extreme breadth. Upon its sloping and irregular floor,
black-green pools, sadly offensive to more senses than
one, spring-fed, and forming the residue of the rain-water
which fills the torrent, lay in muddy holes broadly fringed
with silky grass. Travellers drink without fear this
upper Marenga Mk’hali, which, despite its name, is
rather soft and slimy, than brackish, and sign of wild-beasts&mdash;antelope
and buffalo, giraffe and rhinoceros&mdash;appear
upon its brink. It sometimes dries up in the
heart of the hot season, and then deaths from thirst
occur amongst the porters who, mostly Wanyanwezi, are
not wont to practise abstinence in this particular.
“Sucking-places” are unknown to them, water-bearing
bulbs might here be discovered by the South African
traveller; as a rule, however, the East African is so
plentifully supplied with the necessary that he does not
care to provide for a dry day by unusual means. Ascending
another steep incline we encamped upon a small
step, the half-way gradient of a higher level.</p>

<p>The 24th Sept. was to be a tirikeza: the Baloch and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-248">[248]</span>
the sons of Ramji spent the earlier half in blowing
away gunpowder at antelope, partridge and parrot,
guinea-fowl and floriken, but not a head of game found
its way into camp. The men were hot, tired and testy,
those who had wives beat them, those who had not “let
off the steam” by quarreling with one another. Said
bin Salim, sick and surly, had words concerning a water-gourd
with the brave Khudabakhsh, and the monocular
Jemadar, who made a point of overloading his porters,
bitterly complained because they would not serve him.
At 2 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> we climbed up the last ladder of the rough
and stony incline, which placed us a few hundred feet
above the eastern half of the Lesser Desert. We took
a pleasant leave of the last of the rises; on this line
of road, between Marenga Mk’hali and Western Unyamwezi,
the land, though rolling, has no steep ascents nor
descents.</p>

<p>From the summit of the Marenga Mk’hali step we
travelled till sunset&mdash;the orb of day glaring like a fireball
in our faces,&mdash;through dense thorny jungle and over
grassy plains of black, cracked earth, in places covered
with pebbles and showing extensive traces of shallow inundations
during the rains; in the lower lands huge
blocks of weathered granite stood out abruptly from the
surface, and on both sides, but higher on the right hand,
rose blue cones, some single, others in pairs like
“brothers.” The caravan once rested in a thorny coppice,
based upon rich red and yellow clay whence it was
hurriedly dislodged by a swarm of wild bees. As the sun
sank below the horizon the porters called a halt on a
calabash-grown plain, near a block of stony hill veiled
with cactus and mimosa, below whose northern base ran
a tree-lined Nullah where, they declared, from the presence
of antelope and other game, that water might be
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-249">[249]</span>
found by digging. Vainly Kidogo urged them forwards
declaring that they would fail to reach the Ziwa
or Pond in a single march; they preferred “crowing” and
scooping up sand till midnight to advancing a few
miles, and some gourdsfull of dirty liquid rewarded
their industry.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th of September, I learned
that we had sustained an apparently irreparable loss.
When the caravan was dispersed by bees, a porter took
the opportunity of deserting. This man, who represented
himself as desirous of rejoining at Unyamyembe,
his patron Abdullah bin Musa, the son of the well-known
Indian merchant, had been engaged for four cloths by Said
bin Salim at Ugogi. The Arab with his usual after-wit
found out, when the mishap was announced, that he had
from the first doubted and disliked the man so much
that he had paid down only half the hire. Yet to the
new porter had been committed the most valuable of
our packages, a portmanteau containing the Nautical
Almanac for 1858, the surveying books, and most of
our paper, pens and ink. Said bin Salim, however, was
hardly to be blamed, his continual quarrels with the Baloch
and the sons of Ramji absorbed all his thoughts.
Although the men were unanimous in declaring that
the box never could be recovered, I sent back Bombay
Mabruki and the slave Ambari with particular directions
to search the place where we had been attacked by bees;
it was within three miles, but, as the road was deemed
dangerous, the three worthies preferred passing a few
quiet hours in some snug neighbouring spot.</p>

<p>At 1.30 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> much saddened by the disaster, we resumed
our road and after stretching over a monotonous
grassy plain variegated with dry thorny jungle, we
arrived about sunset at a waterless kraal where we determined
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-250">[250]</span>
to pass the night. Our supplies of liquid ran
low, the Wanyamwezi porters, who carried our pots and
gourds, had drained them on the way, and without drink
an afternoon-march in this droughthy land destroys all
appetite for supper. Some of the porters presently set
out to fill their gourds with the waters of the Ziwa,
thence distant but a few miles; they returned after a four
hours’ absence with supplies which restored comfort and
good humour to the camp.</p>

<p>Before settling for the night Kidogo stood up, and to
loud cries of “Maneno! maneno!”&mdash;words! words!&mdash;equivalent
to our parliamentary hear! hear! delivered
himself of the following <span class="nowrap">speech:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Listen, O ye whites! and ye children of Sayyidi
Majidi! and ye sons of Ramji! hearken to my words,
O ye offspring of the night! The journey entereth
Ugogo&mdash;Ugogo (the orator threw out his arm westward).
Beware, and again beware (he made violent
gesticulations). You don’t know the Wagogo, they are
&mdash;&mdash;s and &mdash;&mdash;s! (he stamped.) Speak not to those
Washenzi pagans; enter not into their houses (he
pointed grimly to the ground). Have no dealings with
them, show no cloth, wire, nor beads (speaking with increasing
excitement). Eat not with them, drink not
with them, and make not love to their women (here the
speech became a scream). Kirangozi of the Wanyamwezi,
restrain your sons! Suffer them not to stray into
the villages, to buy salt out of camp, to rob provisions,
to debauch with beer, or to sit by the wells!” And
thus, for nearly half an hour, now violently, then composedly,
he poured forth the words of wisdom, till the
hubbub and chatter of voices which at first had been
silenced by surprise, brought his eloquence to an end.</p>

<p>We left the jungle-kraal early on the 26th September,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-251">[251]</span>
and after hurrying through thick bush we debouched
upon an open stubbly plain, with herds of gracefully
bounding antelopes and giraffes, who stood for a moment
with long outstretched necks to gaze, and presently
broke away at a rapid, striding, camel’s-trot, their heads
shaking as if they would jerk off, their limbs loose,
and their joints apparently dislocated. About 9
<span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> we sighted the much-talked of Ziwa. The Arabs,
fond of “showing a green garden,” had described to me
at Inenge a piece of water fit to float a man-of-war.
But Kidogo, when consulted, had replied simply with
the Kisawahili proverb, “Khabari ya mb’hali;” <i>i. e.</i>,
“news from afar;”&mdash;<i>a beau mentir qui vient de loin</i>. I
was not therefore surprised to find a shallow pool, which
in India would barely merit the name of tank.</p>

<p>The Ziwa, which lies 3,100 feet above the sea, occupies
the lowest western level of Marenga Mk’háli, and
is the deepest of the many inundated grounds lying to
its north, north-east, and north-west. The extent
greatly varies: in September, 1857, it was a slaty sheet
of water, with granite projections on one side, and about
300 yards in diameter; the centre only could not be
forded. The bottom and the banks were of retentive clay:
a clear ring, whence the waters had subsided, margined
the pool, and beyond it lay a thick thorny jungle. In
early December, 1858, nothing remained but a surface
of dry, crumbling, and deeply-cracked mud, and, according
to travellers, it had long, in consequence of the
scanty rains, been in that state. Caravans always encamp
at the Ziwa when they find water there. The country
around is full of large game, especially elephants, giraffes,
and zebras, who come to drink at night; a few widgeon
are seen breasting the little waves; “kata” (sand-grouse),
of peculiarly large size and dark plumage, flock there with
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-252">[252]</span>
loud cries; and at eventide the pool is visited by guinea-fowl,
floriken, curlews, peewits, wild pigeons, doves, and
hosts of small birds. When the Ziwa is desiccated, travellers
usually encamp in a thick bush, near a scanty clearing,
about one mile to the north-west, where a few scattered
villages of Wagogo have found dirty white water, hard and
bad, in pits varying from twenty to thirty feet in depth.
Here, as elsewhere in eastern Africa, the only trough is
a small ring sunk in the retentive clayey soil, and surrounded
by a little raised dam of mud and loose stones.
A demand is always made for according permission to
draw water&mdash;a venerable custom, dating from the days
of Moses. “Ye shall buy meat of them (the Edomites)
for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water
of them for money, that ye may drink.”&mdash;Deut. ii. 6.
Yet as thirsty, like hungry men, are not to be trifled with,
fatal collisions have resulted from this inhospitable
practice. Some years ago a large caravan of Wanyamwezi
was annihilated in consequence of a quarrel about
water, and lately several deaths occurred in a caravan
led by an Arab merchant, Sallum bin Hamid, because
the wells were visited before the rate of payment was
settled. In several places we were followed upon the
march lest a gourd might be furtively filled. To prevent
exhaustion the people throw euphorbia, asclepias,
and solanaceous plants into the well after a certain hour,
and when not wanted it is bushed over, to keep off
animals, and to check evaporation.</p>

<p>At the Ziwa the regular system of kuhonga, or blackmail,
so much dreaded by travellers, begins in force. Up
to this point all the chiefs are contented with little presents;
but in Ugogo tribute is taken by force, if necessary.
None can evade payment; the porters, fearing
lest the road be cut off to them in future, would refuse
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-253">[253]</span>
to travel unless each chief is satisfied; and when a
quarrel arises they throw down their packs and run
away. Ugogo, since the closing of the northern line
through the Wahumba and the Wamasai tribes, and the
devastation of the southern regions by the Warori, is the
only open line, and the sultans have presumed upon
their power of stopping the way. There is no regular
tariff of taxes: the sum is fixed by the traveller’s
dignity and outfit, which, by means of his slaves, are as
well known to every sultan as to himself. Properly
speaking, the exaction should be confined to the up-caravans;
from those returning a head or two of cattle,
a few hoes, or some similar trifle, are considered ample.
Such, however, was not the experience of the Expedition.
When first travelling through the country the
“Wazungu” were sometimes mulcted to the extent of
fifty cloths by a single chief, and the Arabs congratulated
them upon having escaped so easily. On their downward
march they pleaded against a second demand as
exorbitant as the first, adducing the custom of caravans,
who are seldom mulcted in more than two cows or a pair
of jembe, or iron hoes; the chiefs, however, replied that
as they never expected to see white faces again, it was
their painful duty to make the most from them.</p>

<p>The kuhonga, however, is not unjust. In these regions
it forms the customs-dues of the government: the sultan
receives it nominally, but he must distribute the greater
part amongst his family and councillors, his elders and
attendants. It takes the place of the fees expected by
the Balderabba of the Abyssinians, the Mogasa of the
Gallas, the Abban of the Somal, and the Ghafir and
Rafik amongst the Bedouin Arabs, which are virtually
assertions of supremacy upon their own ground. These
people have not the idea which seems prevalent in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-254">[254]</span>
south, namely, that any man has a right to tread God’s
earth gratis as long as he does not interfere with property.
If any hesitation about the kuhonga be made, the
first question put to the objector will be, “Is this your
ground or my ground?” The practice, which is sanctioned
by the customs of civilised nations, is, however,
vitiated in East Africa by the slave-trade: it becomes
the means of intrusion and extortion, of insolence and
violence. The Wagogo are an importing people, and
they see with envy long strings of what they covet
passing through their territory from the interior to the
coast. They are strong enough to plunder any caravan;
but violence they know would injure them by cutting
off communication with the markets for their ivory.
Thus they have settled into a silent compromise, and their
nice sense of self-interest prevents any transgression
beyond the bounds of reason. The sultans receive
their kuhonga, and the subjects entice away slaves from
every caravan, but the enormous interest upon capital
laid out in the trade still leaves a balance in favour of
the merchants. The Arabs, however, declaring that
the evil is on the increase, propose many remedies&mdash;such
as large armed caravans, sent by their government,
and heavy dues to be exacted from those Wagogo who
may visit the coast. But they are wise enough to murmur
without taking steps which would inevitably exacerbate
the evil. Should it pass a certain point, a
new road will be opened, or the old road will be reopened,
to restore the balance of interests.</p>

<p>At the Ziwa we had many troubles. One Marema,
the sultan of a new settlement situated a few hundred
yards to the north-west visited us on the day of our
arrival and reproving us for “sitting in the jungle,”
pointed out the way to his village. On our replying
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-255">[255]</span>
that we were about to traverse Ugogo by another route,
he demanded his Ada or customs, which being newly-imposed
were at once refused by Kidogo. The sultan,
a small man, a “mere thief,”&mdash;as a poor noble is graphically
described in these lands,&mdash;threatened violence,
whereupon the asses were brought in from grazing and
were ostentatiously loaded before his eyes: when he
changed his tone from threats to beggary. Kidogo
relenting gave him two cloths with a few strings of
beads, preferring this slender disbursement to the
chance of a flight of arrows during the night. His
good judgment was evidenced by the speedy appearance
of the country-people, who brought with them bullocks,
sheep, goats and poultry, water-melons and pumpkins,
honey, butter-milk, whey and curded-milk, an abundance
of holcus and calabash-flour. The latter is made from
the hard dry pulp surrounding the bean-like seed contained
in the ripe gourd: the taste is a not unpleasant
agro-dolce, and the people declare it to be strengthening
food, especially for children; they convert it into porridge
and rude cakes.</p>

<p>This abundance of provaunt caused a halt of four
days at the Ziwa, and it was spent in disputes between
the great Said and the greater Kidogo. The ostensible
“bone of contention,” was cloth advanced by the former
to the porters&mdash;who claimed as their perquisite a bullock
before entering Ugogo&mdash;without consulting the
hard-headed slave, who wounded in his tenderest place
of pride, had influence enough to halt the caravan. The
real cause of the dispute was kept from my ears till
some months afterwards, but secrets in this land are as
the Arabs say, “Like musk, murder, and Basrah-garlic,”
they must out, and Bombay, who could never help blurting
forth the tacenda with the dicenda, at last accidentally
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-256">[256]</span>
unveiled the mystery. Said had deferred taking
overcharge of the outfit from Kidogo till our arrival at
the Ziwa, and the latter felt aggrieved by the sudden
yet tardy demand, which deprived him of the dignity
and the profits of stewardship. Sickness became rife
in camp, the effect of the cold night-winds and the
burning suns, and as usual when men are uncomfortable
violent quarrels ensued. Again the officious Wazira,
shook the torch of discord by ordering Khamisi, an exceedingly
drunken and debauched son of Ramji, to
carry certain bundles which usually graced the shoulders
of Goha, one of the Wak’hutu porters. When words
were exhausted Khamisi drew his blade upon Goha and
was tackled by Wazira, whilst Goha brought the muzzle
of my elephant-gun to bear upon Khamisi and was instantly
collared by Bombay. Being thus “in chancery”
both heroes waxed so “exceedingly brave&mdash;particular,”
that I was compelled to cool their noble bile with a long
pole. At length it became necessary to make Kidogo raise
his veto against the advance of the caravan. He did not
appear before me till summoned half-a-dozen times: when
he at last vouchsafed so to do I dragged rather than led him
to the mat, where sat in surly pride Said bin Salim, with
the monocular Jemadar, and I ordered the trio to quench
with the waters of explanation the fire of anger. After an
apparently satisfactory arrangement Kidogo started up
and disappeared in the huts of his men; it presently
proved that he had so done for the purpose of proposing
to his party, who were now the sole interpreters, that
to Said bin Salim, an ignoramus in such matters, should
be committed the weighty task of settling the amount
of our blackmail and presents with the greedy chiefs of
Ugogo. Had the mischievous project been carried into
execution, we should have been sufferers to some extent:
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-257">[257]</span>
lack of unanimity however caused the measure to be
thrown out. A march was fixed for the next day, when
the bullock, on this occasion the scape-grace, broke its
tether and plunged into the bush: it was followed by
the Baloch and the porters, whose puny arrows, when
they alighted upon the beast’s stern, only goaded it forwards,
and at least threescore matchlock balls were discharged
before one bullet found its billet in the fugitive.
The camp of course then demanded another holiday to
eat beef.</p>

<p>The reader must not imagine that I am making a
“great cry,” about a little matter. Four days are not
easily spent when snowed-up in a country inn, and that
is a feeble comparison for the halt in East Africa, where
outfit is leaking away, the valuable travelling-time is
perhaps drawing to a close, health is palpably failing,
and nothing but black faces made blacker still by
ill-humour and loud squabbles, meet the eye and
ear. Insignificant things they afterwards appear viewed
through the medium of memory, these petty annoyances
of travel; yet at the moment they are severely felt, and
they must be resented accordingly. The African traveller’s
fitness for the task of exploration depends more
upon his faculty of chafing under delays and kicking
against the pricks, than upon his power of displaying
the patience of a Griselda or a Job.</p>

<p>On the 30th September, the last day of our detention
at the Jiwa, appeared a large caravan headed by Said
bin Mohammed of Mbuamaji, with Khalfan bin Khamis,
and several other Coast-Arabs. They brought news
from the sea-board, and,&mdash;wondrous good fortune!&mdash;the
portmanteau containing books which the porter, profiting
by the confusion caused by the swarm of bees, had deposited
in the long grass, at the place where I had
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-258">[258]</span>
directed the slaves to seek it. Some difficulty was at
first made about restitution: the Arab law of “lakit,”
or things trove, being variable, complicated, and altogether
opposed to our ideas. However, two cloths were
given to the man who had charge of it, and the
Jemadar and Said bin Salim were sent to recover it
by any or all means. The merchants were not offended.
They consented to sell for the sum of thirty-five dollars
a strong and serviceable but an old and obstinate
African ass, which after carrying my companion for
many a mile, at last broke its heart when toiling up
the steeps from whose summit the fair waters of the
Central Lake were first sighted. Moreover, they proposed
that for safety and economy the two caravans should
travel together under a single flag, and thus combine to
form a total of 190 men. These Coast-Arabs travelled
in comfort. The brother of Said Mohammed had married
the daughter of Fundikira, Sultan of Unyanyembe,
and thus the family had a double home, on the coast
and in the interior. All the chiefs of the caravan carried
with them wives and female slaves, negroid beauties,
tall, bulky and “plenty of them,” attired in tulip-hues,
cochineal and gamboge, who walked the whole way, and
who when we passed them displayed an exotic modesty
by drawing their head-cloths over cheeks which we were
little ambitious to profane. They had a multitude of
Fundi, or managing men, and male slaves, who bore their
personal bag and baggage, scrip and scrippage, drugs
and comforts, stores and provisions, and who were always
early at the ground to pitch, to surround with a
“pai,” or dwarf drain, and to bush for privacy, with
green boughs, their neat and light ridge-tents of American
domestics. Their bedding was as heavy as ours,
and even their poultry travelled in wicker cages. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-259">[259]</span>
caravan was useful to us in dealing with the Wagogo:
it always managed, however, to precede us on the march,
and to monopolise the best kraals. The Baloch and the
sons of Ramji, when asked on these occasions why
they did not build a palisade, would reply theatrically,
“Our hearts are our fortification!”&mdash;methought a
sorry defence.</p>

<p>By Kidogo’s suggestion I had preferred the middle
line through the hundred miles of dreaded Ugogo: it
was the beaten path, and infested only by four Sultans,
namely: 1. Myandozi of Kifukuru. 2. Magomba of
Kanyenye. 3. Maguru-Mafupi of K’hok’ho; and 4. Kibuya
of Mdaburu. On the 1st October, 1857, we left
the Ziwa late in the morning, and after passing through
the savannahs and the brown jungles of the lower levels,
where giraffe again appeared, the path crested a wave
of ground and debouched upon the table-land of Ugogo.
The aspect was peculiar and unprepossessing. Behind still
towered in sight the Delectable Mountains of Usagara,
mist-crowned and robed in the lightest azure, with
streaks of a deep plum-colour, fronting the hot low land
of Marenga Mk’hali, whose tawny face was wrinkled
with lines of dark jungle. On the north was a tabular
range of rough and rugged hill, above which rose
three distant cones pointed out as the haunts of the
robber Wahumba: at its base was a deep depression, a
tract of brown brush patched with yellow grass, inhabited
only by the elephant, and broken by small outlying
hillocks. Southwards scattered eminences of tree-crowned
rock rose a few yards from the plain which
extended to the front, a clearing of deep red or white
soil, decayed vegetation based upon rocky or sandy
ground, here and there thinly veiled with brown brush
and golden stubbles: its length, about four miles, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-260">[260]</span>
studded with square villages, and with the stately but
grotesque calabash. This giant is to the vegetable what
the elephant is to the animal world:&mdash;the Persians call
it the “practice-work of nature”&mdash;its disproportionate
conical bole rests upon huge legs exposed to view by
the washing away of the soil, and displays excrescences
which in pious India would merit a coat of vermilion.
From the neck extend gigantic gnarled arms, each one
a tree, whose thinnest twig is thick as a man’s finger,
and their weight causes them to droop earthwards, giving
to the outline the shape of a huge dome. In many parts
the unloveliness of its general appearance is varied by
the wrinkles and puckerings which, forming by granulation
upon the oblongs where the bark has been removed
for fibre, give the base the appearance of being chamfered
and fluted; and often a small family of trunks,
four or five in number, springs from the same
root. At that season all were leafless; at other times
they are densely foliaged, and contrasting with their
large timber and with their coarse fleshy leaf, they are
adorned with the delicatest flowers of a pure virgin-white,
which, opening at early dawn, fade and fall before
eventide. The babe-tree issues from the ground about
one foot in diameter: in Ugogo, however, all those observed
were of middle age. The young are probably
grubbed up to prevent their encumbering the ground,
and when decayed enough to be easily felled, they are
converted into firewood. By the side of these dry and
leafless masses of dull dead hue, here and there a mimosa
or a thorn was beginning to bear the buds of promise
green as emeralds. The sun burned like the breath of
a bonfire, a painful glare&mdash;the reflection of the terrible
crystal above,&mdash;arose from the hot earth; warm Siroccos
raised clouds of dust, and in front the horizon was so
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-261">[261]</span>
distant, that, as the Arabs expressed themselves, “a man
might be seen three marches off.”</p>

<p>We were received with the drumming and the ringing
of bells attached to the ivories, with the yells and
frantic shouts of two caravans halted at Kifukuru: one
was that of Said Mohammed, who awaited our escort,
the other a return “Safari,” composed of about 1,000
Wanyamwezi porters, headed by four slaves of Salim bin
Rashid, an Arab merchant settled at Unyanyembe. The
country people also flocked to stare at the phenomenon;
they showed that excitement which some few years ago
might have been witnessed in more polished regions
when a “horrible murder” roused every soul from
Tweed banks to Land’s End; when, to gratify a morbid
destructiveness, artists sketched, literati described, tourists
visited, and curio-hunters met to bid for the
rope and the murderer’s whiskers. Yet I judged favourably
of the Wagogo by their curiosity, which stood out in
strong relief against the apathy and the uncommunicativeness
of the races lately visited. Such inquisitiveness
is amongst barbarians generally a proof of improvability,&mdash;of
power to progress. One man who had visited
Zanzibar could actually speak a few words of Hindostani,
and in Ugogo, and there only, I was questioned by the
chiefs concerning Uzungu “White-land,” the mysterious
end of the world in which beads are found under ground,
and where the women weave such cottons. From the
day of our entering to that of our leaving the country,
every settlement turned out its swarm of gazers, men
and women, boys and girls, some of whom would follow
us for miles with explosions of Hi!&mdash;i!&mdash;i! screams of
laughter and cries of excitement, at a long high trot,&mdash;most
ungraceful of motion!&mdash;and with a scantiness of
toilette which displayed truly unseemly spectacles. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-262">[262]</span>
matrons, especially the aged matrons, realised Madame
Pernelle’s description of an unpleasant <span class="nowrap">female&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="noindent">and of their sex the old men were ever the most pertinacious
and intrusive, the most surly and quarrelsome.
Vainly the escort attempted to arrest the course of this
moving multitude of semi-nude barbarity. I afterwards
learned that the two half-caste Arabs who had passed
us at Muhama, Khalfan and Id, the sons of Muallim
Salim of Zanzibar, had, whilst preceding us, spread
through Ugogo malevolent reports concerning the Wazungu.
They had one eye each and four arms; they
were full of “knowledge,” which in these lands means
magic; they caused rain to fall in advance and left
droughts in their rear; they cooked water melons and
threw away the seeds, thereby generating small-pox;
they heated and hardened milk, thus breeding a murrain
amongst cattle; and their wire, cloth, and beads caused
a variety of misfortunes; they were kings of the sea, and
therefore white-skinned and straight-haired&mdash;a standing
mystery to these curly-pated people&mdash;as are all men
who live in salt water; and next year they would return
and seize the country. Suspicion of our intentions
touching “territorial aggrandisement” was a fixed idea:
everywhere the value attached by barbarians to their
homes is in inverse ratio to the real worth of the article.
Hence mountaineers are proverbially patriotic. Thus
the lean Bedouins of Arabia and the lank Somal, though
they own that they are starving, never sight a stranger
without suspecting that he is spying out the wealth of
the land. “What will happen to us?” asked the
Wagogo; “we never yet saw this manner of man!”
But the tribe cannot now forfeit intercourse with the
coast: they annoyed us to the utmost, they made the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-263">[263]</span>
use of their wells a daily source of trouble, they charged
us double prices, and when they brought us provisions
for sale, they insisted upon receiving the price of even
the rejected articles; yet they did not proceed to open
outrage. Our timid Arab, the Baloch, the sons of
Ramji, and the porters humoured them in every whim.
Kidogo would not allow observations to be taken with
a bright sextant in presence of the mobility. He declined
to clear the space before the tent, as the excited
starers, some of whom had come from considerable distances,
were apt under disappointment to wax violent;
and though he once or twice closed the tent-flaps,
he would not remove the lines of men, women, and
children, who stretched themselves for the greater convenience
of peeping and peering, lengthways upon the
ground. Whenever a Mnyamwezi porter interfered, he
was arrogantly told to begone, and he slunk away, praying
us to remember that these men are “Wagogo.”
Caravan after caravan had thus taught them to become
bullies, whereas a little manliness would soon have
reduced them to their proper level. They are neither
brave nor well-armed, and their prestige rests solely
upon their feat in destroying about one generation ago
a caravan of Wanyamwezi&mdash;an event embalmed in a
hundred songs and traditions. They seemed to take a
fancy to the Baloch, who received from the fair sex
many a little souvenir in the shape of a kid or a water-melon.
Whenever the Goanese Valentine was sent to a
village he was politely and hospitably welcomed, and
seated upon a three-legged stool by the headman; and
generally the people agreed in finding fault with their
principal Sultans, declaring that they unwisely made the
country hateful to “Wakonongo,” or travellers. Fortunately
for the Expedition several scions of the race saw
the light safely during our transit of Ugogo: had an
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-264">[264]</span>
accident occurred to a few babies or calves, our return
through the country would have been difficult and dangerous.
All received the name of “Muzungu,” and
thus there must now be a small colony of black “white
men” in this part of the African interior.</p>

<p>At Kifukuru I was delayed a day whilst settling the
blackmail of its Sultan Miyandozi. Said bin Salim, the
Jemadar, and Kidogo called upon him in the morning and
were received in the gateway of a neat “Tembe,” the
great man disdaining to appear on so trivial an occasion.
This Sultan is the least powerful of the four; he is
plundered by the Warori tribes living to the south-west,
and by his western neighbour, Magomba; his subjects
are poorly clad, and are little ornamented compared with
those occupying the central regions, where they have the
power to detain travellers and to charge them exorbitantly
for grain and water. Yet Miyandozi demanded
four white and six blue shukkahs; besides which I was
compelled to purchase for him from the sons of Ramji,
who of course charged treble its value, a “Sohari” or
handsome silk and cotton loin-cloth. In return he sent&mdash;it
appeared to be in irony&mdash;one kayla, or four small measures
of grain. The slaves of Salim bin Rashid obliged
me with a few pounds of rice, for which I gave them a
return in gunpowder, and they undertook to convey to
Zanzibar a package of reports, indents, and letters,
which was punctually delivered. An ugly accident had
nearly happened that night; the Wanyamwezi porters
managed to fire the grass round a calabash tree, against
which they had stretched their loads, and a powder-magazine&mdash;fortunately
fire-proof&mdash;was blackened and charred
by the flames. A traveller cannot be too careful about his
ammunition in these lands. I have seen a slave smoking
a water pipe, tied for convenience of carriage to a leaky
keg of powder; and another in the caravan of Salim bin
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-265">[265]</span>
Sayf of Dut’humi, resting the muzzle of his musket
against a barrel of ammunition, fired it to try its strength,
and blew himself up with several of his comrades.</p>

<p>On the 3rd October we quitted Kifukuru in the
afternoon, and having marched nearly six hours we
encamped in one of the strips of waterless brown
jungles which throughout Ugogo divide the cultivated
districts from one another, and occupy about half the
superficies of the land. The low grounds, inundated
during the rains, were deeply cracked, and my weak ass,
led by the purblind Shahdad, fell with violence upon my
knee, leaving a mixture of pain and numbness which
lasted for some months. On the next day we resumed
our journey betimes through a thick rugged jungle and
over a rolling grassy plain, which extended to the
frontier of Kanyenye, where Sultan Magomba rules.
The 5th October saw us in the centre of Kanyenye,
a clearing about ten miles in diameter. The surface is
a red tamped clayey soil, dotted with small villages, huge
calabashes, and stunted mimosas; water is found in
wells or rather pits sunk from ten to twelve feet in the
lower lands, or in the sandy beds of the several Fiumaras.
Flocks and herds abound, and the country is as cultivated
and populous as the saline nitrous earth, and the scarceness
of the potable element, which often tarnishes silver
like sulphur-fumes, permits.</p>

<p>At Kanyenye I was delayed four days to settle blackmail
with Magomba, the most powerful of the Wagogo
chiefs. He was on this, as on a subsequent occasion,
engaged in settling a cause arising from Uchawi or
Black Magic; yet all agree that in Ugogo, where, to
quote the “Royal Martyr’s” words,</p>

<p class="noindent">there is perhaps less of wizardhood and witchcraft,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-266">[266]</span>
and consequently less of its normal consequences, fiscs
and massacres, than in any other region between the
Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. “Arrow-heads” employed
every art of wild diplomacy to relieve me of as
much cloth as possible. I received, when encamped at
the Ziwa, a polite message declaring his desire to see
white men; but&mdash;“the favour of the winds produces
dust”&mdash;I was obliged to acknowledge the compliment
with two cottons. On arrival at his head-quarters I was
waited upon by an oily cabinet of Wazirs and elders,
who would not depart without their “respects”&mdash;four
cottons. The next demand was made by his favourite
wife, a peculiarly hideous old princess with more
wrinkles than hairs, with no hair black and no tooth
white, and attended by ladies in waiting as unprepossessing
as herself: she was not to be dismissed without
a fee of six cottons. At last, accompanied by a mob
of courtiers, who crowded in like an African House
of Commons, appeared in person the magnifico. He
was the only Sultan that ever entered my tent in Ugogo&mdash;pride
and a propensity for strong drink prevented
other visits. He was much too great a man to call
upon the Arab merchants, but in our case curiosity
had mastered state considerations. Magomba was a
black and wrinkled elder, drivelling and decrepid, with
a half-bald head from whose back and sides depended
a few straggling corkscrews of iron gray: he wore a
coat of castor-oil and a “Barsati” loin-cloth, which
grease and use had changed from blue to black. A few
bead strings decorated his neck, large flexible anklets
of brass wire adorned his legs, solid brass rings, single
and in coils, which had distended his earlobes almost to
splitting, were tied by a string over his cranium,
and his horny soles were defended by single-soled
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-267">[267]</span>
sandals, old, dirty, and tattered. He chewed his quid
and he expectorated without mercy; he asked many a
silly question, yet he had ever an eye to the main
chance. He demanded and received five “cloths with
names,” which I was again compelled to purchase at an
exorbitant price from the Baloch and slaves, one coil of
brass wire, four blue cottons, and ten “domestics;” the
total amounted to fifty shukkahs, here worth at least
fifty dollars, and exhausting nearly two-thirds of a
porter’s load. His return present was the leanest of
calves; when it was driven into camp with much parade,
his son, who had long been looking out for a fit opportunity,
put in a claim for three cottons.</p>

<p>Magomba before our departure exacted from Kidogo
an oath that his Wazungu would not smite the land
with drought or with fatal disease, declaring that all
we had was in his hands. He boasted, and with truth,
of his generosity. It was indeed my firm conviction
from first to last, that in case of attack or surprise I
had not a soul except my companion to stand by me:
all those who accompanied us could, and consequently
would, have saved their lives;&mdash;<i>we</i> must have perished.
We should have been as safe with six as with sixty
guns; but I would by no means apply to these regions
Mr. Galton’s opinion, “that the last fatal expedition
of Mungo Park is full of warning to travellers who
propose exploring with a large body of men.” For
though sixty guns do not suffice to prevent attack in
Ugogo, 600 stout fellows armed with the “hot-mouthed
weapon” might march through the length and breadth
of Central Africa.</p>

<p>During our four days’ detention at Kanyenye, I was
compelled to waste string after string of beads in persuading
the people to water the porters and asses. Yet their
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-268">[268]</span>
style of proceeding proved that it was greed of gain,
not scarcity of the element, which was uppermost in
their minds; they would agree to supply us with an
unlimited quantity, and then would suddenly gather
round the well and push away the Wanyamwezi, bidding
them go and fetch more beads. All the caravan
took the opportunity of loading itself with salt. Whilst
the halt lasted, my companion brought in a fine-flavoured
pallah and other antelopes, with floriken, guinea-fowl, and
partridge. Neither he nor I, however, had strength
enough, nor had we time, to attack the herds of elephants
that roam over the valley whose deep purple
line separates the table-land of Ugogo from the blue
hills of the Wahumba to the north. And here, perhaps,
a few words concerning the prospects of sportsmen
in this part of Africa, may save future travellers from
the mistake into which I fell. I expected great things,
and returned without realising a single hope. This
portion of the peninsula is a remarkable contrast to
the line traversed by Dr. Livingstone, where the animals
standing within bow-shot were so numerous and fearless,
that the burden of provisions was often unnecessary.
In the more populous parts game has melted away
before the woodman’s axe and the hunters’ arrows:
even where large tracks of jungle abound with water
and forage, the note of a bird rarely strikes the ear, and
during a long day’s march not a single large animal will
be seen from the beaten track. It is true that in
some places, there is</p>

<p class="noindent">The park lands of Dut’humi, the jungles and forests
of Ugogi and Mgunda Mk’hali, the barrens of Usukuma,
and the tangled thickets of Ujiji, are full of noble
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-269">[269]</span>
game,&mdash;lions and leopards, elephants and rhinoceroses,
wild cattle, giraffes, gnus, zebras, quaggas, and ostriches.
But these are dangerous regions where the sportsman
often cannot linger for a day. Setting aside the minor
considerations of miasma and malaria,&mdash;the real or
fancied perils of the place, and the want of food, or the
difficulty of procuring water, would infallibly cause the
porters to desert. Here are no Cape-waggons, at once
house, store, and transport; no “Ships of the Desert,”
never known to run away; in fact there is no vehicle
but man, and he is so impatient and headstrong, so suspicious
and timorous, that he must be humoured in every
whim. As sportsmen know, it is difficult to combine surveying
operations and collection of specimens with a pursuit
which requires all a man’s time; in these countries,
moreover, no merely hunting-expedition would pay,
owing to the extraordinary expense of provisions and
carriage. Thus Venator will be reduced to use his
“shooting-iron” on halting days, and at the several
periods of his journey, and his only consolation will be
the prospect of wreaking vengeance upon the hippopotamus
and the crocodile of the coast, if his return there
be entered in the book of Time. Finally, East Africa
wants the vast variety of animals, especially the beautiful
antelopes, which enrich the lists of the Cape Fauna.
The tale of those observed in short: the horns of the
oryx were seen, the hartebeest and steinbok, the saltiana
and the pallah,&mdash;the latter affording excellent
venison,&mdash;were shot. The country generally produces
the “Suiya,” a little antelope with reddish coat and
diminutive horns, about the size of an English hare,
the swangura, or sungula, an animal somewhat larger
than the saltiana, and of which, according to the people,
the hind only has horns; and at K’hutu my companion
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-270">[270]</span>
saw a double-horned antelope which he thought
resembled the “Chouka-singa,” (<i>Tetraceros Quadricornis</i>)
of Nepaul. The species of birds, also, are scarcely
more numerous than the beasts; the feathered tribe
is characterised by sombreness of plumage, and their
song is noisy but not harmonious, unpleasant, perhaps
because strange, to the European ear.</p>

<p>On the 8th October appeared at Kanyenye a large down-caravan
headed by Abdullah bin Nasib, a Msawahili of
Zanzibar, whose African name is Kisesa. This good
man began with the usual token of hospitality, the gift
of a goat, and some measures of the fine Unyanyembe rice,
of which return-parties carry an ample store: he called
upon me at once with several companions,&mdash;one of them
surprised me not a little by an English “good morning,”&mdash;and
he kindly volunteered to halt a day whilst we wrote
reports and letters, life-certificates, and duplicate-indents
upon Zanzibar for extra supplies of drugs and
medical comforts, cloth and beads. The asses were now
reduced to five, and as Magomba refused to part with
any of his few animals, at any price,&mdash;on the coast
I had been assured that asses were as numerous as dogs
in Ugogo&mdash;Abdullah gave me one of his riding-animals,
and would take nothing for it except a little
medicine, and a paper acknowledging his civility.
Several of the slaves and porters had been persuaded
by the Wagogo to desert, and Abdullah busied
himself to recover them. One man, who had suddenly
deposited his pack upon the path and had disappeared
in the jungle during the noonday halt, was
pointed out by a woman to Kidogo, and was found
lurking in a neighbouring village, where the people
refused to give him up. Abdullah sent for Magomba’s
four chief “ministers,” and persuaded them to render
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-271">[271]</span>
active aid: they seized the fellow, took from him his
wire and his nine cloths, appropriated four, and left
me five wherewith to engage another porter. The deserter
was of course dismissed, but the severity of the
treatment did not prevent three desertions on the next
day.</p>

<p>The 10th October ushered in an ugly march. Emerging
betimes from the glaring white and red plains of
Kanyenye, dotted with fields, villages, and calabashes,
we unloaded in a thin jungle of mimosa and grass-bunches,
near sundry pools, then almost dried up, but
still surrounded by a straggling growth of chamærops
and verdurous thorns. The bush gave every opportunity
to the porters, who had dispersed in the halt, to
desert with impunity. In our hurried morning tramp,
want of carriage had caused considerable confusion, and
at 2 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, when again the word “load” was given for
a tirikeza, everything seemed to go wrong. Said bin
Salim and the Jemadar hurried forwards, leaving me to
manage the departure with Kidogo, who, whilst my
companion lay under a calabash almost unable to move,
substituted for his strong Mnyamwezi ass a wretched
animal unable to bear the lightest load. The Baloch
Belok was asked to carry our only gourd full of water;
he pleaded sickness as an excuse. And, when the rear
of the caravan was about to march, Kidogo, who alone
knew the way, hastened on so fast that he left us to
wander through a labyrinth of elephants’ tracks, hedged
in by thorns and brambly trees, which did considerable
damage to clothes and cutis.</p>

<p>Having at length found the way, we advanced over a
broad, open, and grassy plain, striped with southwards-trending
sandy water-courses of easy ascent and descent,
and lined with a green aromatic vegetation, in which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-272">[272]</span>
tall palm suggested a resemblance to the valley-plains of
the Usagara Mountains. As night fell upon us like a
pall, we entered the broken red ground that limits the flat
westwards, and, ascending a dark ridge of broken, stony,
ground, and a dense thorn-bush, we found ourselves upon
a higher level. The asses stumbled, the men grumbled,
and the want of water severely tried the general
temper.</p>

<p>From this cold jungle&mdash;the thermometer showed a
minimum of 54° F.&mdash;we emerged at dawn on the
11th October, and after three hours’ driving through
a dense bush of various thorns, with calabashes reddened
by the intense heat, and tripping upon the narrow
broken path that ran over rolling ground, we found the
porters halted at some pits full of sweet clear water.
Here the caravan preserved a remarkable dead silence.
I inquired the cause. The Coast-Arabs who accompanied
us were trying an experiment, which, had it
failed, would have caused trouble, expense, and waste of
time; they were attempting to pass without blackmail
the little clearing of Usek’he, which lay to the south of
the desert-road, and they knew that its Sultan, Ganza
Mikono, usually posted a party upon the low masses of
bristling hill hard by, to prevent caravans evading his
dues. As no provisions were procurable in the jungle,
it was judged better to proceed, and the sun was in the
zenith before we reached the district of K’hok’ho. We
halted under a spreading tree, near the head-quarter
village of its villanous Sultan, in an open plain of
millet and panicum-stubbles. Presently Kidogo, disliking
the appearance of things&mdash;the men, rushing with
yells of excitement from their villages, were forming a
dense ring around us; the even more unmanageable old
women stared like <i>sages femmes</i>, and already a Mnyamwezi
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-273">[273]</span>
porter had been beaten at the well&mdash;stirred us up
and led the way to an open jungle about a mile distant.
There we were safe; no assailant would place himself
upon the plain, the Coast-Arabs were close at hand, and
in the bush we should have been more than a match
for the Wagogo.</p>

<p>The Baloch, fatigued by the tedious marches of the
last two days, had surlily refused their escort to our
luggage, as well as to ourselves. When the camp was
pitched, I ordered a goat to be killed; and, serving out
rations to the sons of Ramji and the porters, I gave
them none, a cruel punishment to men whose souls
centered in their ingesta. The earlier part of the
evening was spent by them in enumerating their
grievances&mdash;they were careful to speak in four dialects,
so that all around might understand them, in discussing
their plans of desertion, and in silencing the contradiction
of their commander, the monocular Jemadar,
who, having forsworn opium, now headed the party in
opposition to the mutineers. They complained that they
were faint for want of meat&mdash;the fellows were driving a
bullock and half a dozen goats, which they had purchased
with cloth, certainly not their own. I had, they grumbled,
given them no ghee or honey, consequently they were
obliged to “eat dry”&mdash;they knew this to be false, as they
had received both at Kanyenye. We had made them
march ten “Cos” in our eagerness to obtain milk&mdash;they
were the first to propose reaching a place where provisions
were procurable. The unmanageables, Khudabakhsh,
Shahdad, and Belok, proposed an immediate departure,
but a small majority carried the day in favour of desertion
next morning. Kidogo and the sons of Ramji
ridiculed, as was their wont, the silly boasters with, “Of
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-274">[274]</span>
a truth, brethren! the coast is far off, and ye are hungry
men!” On the ensuing day, when a night’s reflection
had cooled down their noble bile, they swallowed their
words like buttered parsnips. I heard no more of their
plans, and in their demeanour they became cringing as
before.</p>

<p>The transit of the K’hok’ho clearing, which is also
called the Nyika, or wilderness, is considered the nucleus
of travellers’ troubles in Ugogo. The difficulty is caused
by its Sultan, M’ana Miaha, popularly known as Maguru
Mafupi, or Short-shanks. This petty tyrant, the most
powerful, however, of the Wagogo chiefs, is a toothache
to strangers, who complain that he cannot even
plunder <i>à l’aimable</i>. He was described to me as a short
elderly man, nearly bald, chocolate-coloured, and remarkable
for the duck-like conformation which gave origin to
his nickname. His dress was an Arab check round his
loins, and another thrown over his shoulders. He becomes
man, idiot, and beast with clockwork-regularity
every day; when not disguised in liquor he is surly
and unreasonable, and when made merry by his cups he
refuses to do business. He is in the habit of detaining
Wanyamwezi caravans to hoe his fields, and he often
applies them to a <i>corvée</i> of five or six days during the
spring-time, before he will consent to receive his blackmail.</p>

<p>We were delayed five days at K’hok’ho to lay in provisions
for four marches, and by the usual African pretexts,
various and peculiar. On the afternoon of arrival
it would have been held indecent haste to trouble His
Highness. On the first morning His Highness’s spouse
was unwell, and during the day he was “sitting upon
Pombe,” in other words, drinking beer. On the second
he received, somewhat scurvily, a deputation headed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-275">[275]</span>
Said bin Salim, the Coast-Arab merchants, and the
Jemadar. Two Wazagira, or chief-councillors, did the
palaver, which was conducted, for dignity, outside the
royal hovel. He declared that the two caravans must compound
separately, and that in my case he would be satisfied
with nothing under six porters’ loads. As about one-twelfth
of his demand was offered to him, he dismissed
them with ignominy, affirming that he held me equal to
the Sayyid of Zanzibar, and accordingly that he should
demand half the outfit. The third day was spent by the
Coast-Arabs in haggling with the courtiers before His
Highness, who maintained a solemn silence, certainly the
easiest plan; and the present was paraded, as is customary
on such occasions, in separate heaps, each intended
for a particular person, but Her Highness, justly offended
by the flimsiness of a bit of chintz, seized a huge wooden
ladle and hooted and hunted the offenders out of doors.
After high words the Arabs returned, and informed me
that things were looking desperate. I promised assistance
in case of violence being offered to them,&mdash;a civility which
they acknowledged by sending a shoulder of beef. The
fourth day was one of dignified idleness. We received
a message that the court was again sitting upon
Pombe, and we too well understood that His Highness,
with his spouse and cabinet, were drunk as drunk could
be. On the morning of the fifth day, a similar delaying
process was attempted; but as the testy Kidogo, who
had taken the place of the tame Said, declared that
the morrow should see us march in the afternoon, the
present was accepted, and the two or three musket shots
usual on such occasions sounded the joyful tidings that
we were at liberty to proceed. The unconscionable extortioner
had received one coil of brass wire, four
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-276">[276]</span>
“cloths with names,” eight domestics, eight blue cottons,
and thirty strings of coral beads. Not contented with
this, he demanded two Arab checks, and these failing, a
double quantity of beads, and another domestic. I
compromised the affair with six feet of crimson broadcloth,
an article which I had not produced, as the Coast-Arabs,
who owned none, declared that such an offering
would cause difficulties in their case. But as they
charged me double and treble prices for the expensive
cloths which the Sultan required, and which, as they
had been omitted in our outfit, it was necessary to purchase
from them, I at length thought myself justified in
economising by the only means in my power. The
fiery-tempered Coast-Arabs left K’hok’ho with rage in
their hearts and curses under their tongues. These
men usually think outside their heads, but they know
that in Ugogo the merest pretext&mdash;the loosing a hot
word, touching a woman, offending a boy, or taking in
vain the name of the Sultan&mdash;infallibly leads to being
mulcted in cloth.</p>

<p>I was delighted to escape from the foul strip of crowded
jungle in which we had halted. A down-caravan of
Wanyamwezi had added its quotum of discomfort to
the place. Throughout the fiery day we were stung by
the Tzetze, and annoyed by swarms of bees and pertinacious
gadflies. On one occasion an army of large
poisonous siyafu, or black pismire, drove us out of the
tent by the wounds which it inflicted between the
fingers and on other tender parts of the body, before a
kettle of boiling water persuaded them to abandon us.
These ant-fiends made the thin-skinned asses mad with
torture. The nights were cold and raw, and when we
awoke in the morning we found some valuable article
rendered unserviceable by the termites. K’hok’ho was
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-277">[277]</span>
an ill-omened spot. There my ass “Seringe,” sole survoice
of the riding animals brought from Zanzibar,
was so torn by a hyæna that I was compelled to leave
it behind. I was afterwards informed that it had
soon died of its wounds. The next mishap was the desertion
of the fifteen Wanyamwezi porters who had been
hired and paid at Ugogi. These men had slept in the
same kraal with the somnolent sons of Ramji, and
had stealthily disappeared during the night. As usual,
though they carried off their own, they had left our loads
behind, that they might reach their homes with greater
speed. They would choose a jungle road, to avoid the
danger of slavery, and living the while upon roots and
edible grasses, would traverse the desert separating them
from their country in three or four days. This desertion
of fifteen men first suggested to me that my weary
efforts and wearing anxiety about carriage were to a
certain extent self-inflictions. Expecting to see half the
outfit left upon the ground, I was surprised by the readiness
with which it disappeared. The men seemed to
behave best whenever things were palpably at the worst;
besides which, as easily as the baggage of 50 porters
was distributed amongst 100, so easily were the loads
of 100 men placed upon the shoulders of 50. Indeed, the
original Wanyamwezi gang, who claimed by right extra
pay for carrying extra weight, though fiercely opposed to
lifting up an empty gourd gratis, were ever docile when
a heavier pack brought with it an increase of cloth and
beads.</p>

<p>However, the march on the 17th October had its trifling
hardships. My companion rode forward on the ass lately
given to us by Abdullah bin Nasib, whilst I, remaining
behind and finding that no carriage could be procured for
two bags of clothes and shoes, placed them upon my animal
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-278">[278]</span>
the Mnyamwezi bought at Inenge, inasmuch as it appeared
somewhat stronger than the half-dozen wretched
brutes that flung themselves upon the ground apparently
too fagged to move. I had, however, overrated its
powers: it soon became evident that I must walk, or that
the valuable cargo must be left behind. Trembling
with weakness, I set out to traverse the length of the
Mdáburu Jungle. The memory of that march is not
pleasant: the burning sun and the fiery reflected heat
arising from the parched ground&mdash;here a rough, thorny,
and waterless jungle, where the jasmine flowered and the
frankincense was used for fuel; there a grassy plain of
black and sun-cracked earth&mdash;compelled me to lie down
every half-hour. The watergourds were soon drained
by my attendant Baloch; and the sons of Ramji,
who, after reaching the resting-place, had returned with
ample stores for their comrades, hid their vessels on my
approach. Sarmalla, a donkey-driver, the model of a
surly negro, whose crumpled brow, tightened eyes and
thick lips which shot-out on the least occasion of excitement,
showed what was going on within his head, openly
refused me the use of his gourd, and&mdash;thirst is even
less to be trifled with than hunger&mdash;found ample reason
to repent himself of the proceeding. Near the end
of the jungle I came upon a party of the Baloch, who,
having seized upon a porter belonging to a large caravan
of Wanyamwezi that had passed us on that march,
were persuading him, half by promises and half by
threats, to carry their sleeping mats and their empty
gourds. The strict and positive orders as regards enticing
away deserters which I had issued at Inenge, were
looked upon by them, in their all-engrossing egotism, as a
mere string of empty words. I could do nothing beyond
threatening to report their conduct to their master, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-279">[279]</span>
dismissing the man, who obviously stood in fear of death,
with his tobacco and hoes duly counted back to him. Towards
the end of that long march I saw with pleasure the
kindly face of Seedy Bombay, who was returning to me
in hot haste, leading an ass, and carrying a few scones
and hard-boiled eggs. Mounting, I resumed my way,
and presently arrived at the confines of Mdáburu,
where, under a huge calabash, stood our tent, amidst a
kraal of grass boothies, surrounded by a heaped-up ridge
of thorns.</p>

<p>Mdáburu is the first important district in the land
of Uyanzi, which, beginning from Western K’hok’ho, extends
as far as Tura, the eastern frontier of Unyamwezi-land.
It is a fertile depression of brick-red earth,
bisected by a broad, deep, and sandy Fiumara, which, trending
southwards, supplies from five pits water in plenty
even during the driest season. It is belted on all sides
by a dense jungle, over whose dark brown line appeared
the summits of low blue cones, and beyond them long
streaks of azure ridge, beautified by distance into the semblance
of a sea. We were delayed two days at this, the
fourth and westernmost district of Ugogo. It was necessary
to lay in a week’s provision for the party&mdash;ever
a tedious task in these regions, but more especially in the
dead of winter&mdash;moreover, the Sultan Kibuya expected
the settlement of his blackmail. From this man we experienced
less than the usual incivility: by birth a Mkimbu
foreigner, and fearing at that time wars and rumours
of wars on the part of his villanous neighbour, Maguru
Mafupi, he contented himself with a present which may
be estimated at nineteen cloths, whereas the others had
murmured at forty and fifty. However, he abated nothing
of his country’s pretentious pride. A black, elderly man,
dressed in a grimy cloth, without other ornament but
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-280">[280]</span>
a broad ivory bracelet covering several inches of his
right wrist, he at first refused to receive the deputation
because his “ministers” were absent; and during the
discourse about the amount of blackmail, he sat preserving
an apathetic silence, outside his dirty lodging in the
huge kraal which forms his capital. The demand concluded
with a fine silk-cotton cloth, on the part of his
wife; and when “ma femme” appears on such occasions
in these regions, as in others further west, it is a sure
sign that the stranger is to be taken in. As usual
with the East African chiefs, Kibuya was anxious to
detain me, not only in order that his people might profitably
dispose of their surplus stores, but also because
the presence of so many guns would go far to modify
the plans of his enemies. His attempts at delay, however,
were skilfully out-manœuvred by Said bin Salim,
who broke through all difficulties with the hardihood
of fear. The little man’s vain terrors made him put the
ragged kraal which surrounded us into a condition of
defence, and every night he might be seen stalking like
a troubled spirit amongst the forms of sleeping men.</p>

<p>At Mdáburu I hired two porters from the caravan
that accompanied us; and Said bin Salim began somewhat
tardily to take the usual precautions against desertion.
He was ordered, before the disappearance of the porters
that levanted at K’hok’ho, to pack their hire in our loads,
and every evening to chain up the luggage heaped in
front of our tent. The accident caused by his neglect
rendered him now quasi-obedient. Moreover, two or
three Baloch were told off to precede the line, and as
many to bring up the rear. The porters, as I have
said, hold it a point of honour not to steal their packs;
but if allowed to straggle forwards, or to loiter behind,
they will readily attempt the recovery of their goods by
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-281">[281]</span>
opening their burdens, which they afterwards abandon
upon the road. The Coast-Arabs, in return for some
small shot, which is here highly prized, assisted me by
carrying some surplus luggage. Amongst other articles,
two kegs of gunpowder were committed to them: both
were punctually returned at Unyanyembe, where gunpowder
sells at two cloths, or half a Frasilah (17·5 lbs.)
of ivory per lb; but the bungs had been stove in, and a
quarter of the contents had evaporated. The evening
of the second day’s halt closed on us before the
rations for the caravan were collected, and seventeen
shukkah, with about a hundred strings of beads, barely
produced a sufficiency of grain.</p>

<p>From the Red Vale of Mdáburu three main lines traverse
the desert between Ugogo and Unyamwezi.
The northernmost, called Njia T’humbi, leads in a west-north-westerly
direction to Usukuma. Upon this track
are two sultans and several villages. The central “Karangásá,”
or “Mdáburu,” is that which will be described
in the following pages. The southernmost, termed
Uyánzi, sets out from K’hok’ho, and passes through the
settlements known by the name of Jiwe lá Singá. It
is avoided by the porters, dreading to incur the wrath
of Sultan Kibuyá, who would resent their omitting
to visit his settlement, M’dáburu.</p>

<p>These three routes pass through the heart of the
great desert and elephant-ground “Mgunda Mk’hali”&mdash;explained
by the Arabs to mean in Kinyamwezi, the Fiery
“Shamba” or Field. Like Marenga Mk’hali, it is a desert,
because it contains no running water nor wells, except
after rain. The name is still infamous, but its ill-fame
rests rather upon tradition than actuality; in fact, its
dimensions are rapidly shrinking before the torch and
axe. About fifteen years ago it contained twelve long
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-282">[282]</span>
stages, and several tirikeza; now it is spanned in eight
marches. The wildest part is the first half from
Mdáburu to Jiwe lá Mkoa, and even here, it is reported,
villages of Wakimbu are rising rapidly on the north and
south of the road. The traveller, though invariably
threatened with drought and the death of cattle, will
undergo little hardship beyond the fatigue of the first
three forced marches through the “Fiery Field;” in fact,
he will be agreeably surprised by its contrast with the
desert of Marenga Mk’hali.</p>

<p>From east to west the diagonal breadth of Mgunda
Mk’hali is 140 miles. The general aspect is a dull uniform
bush, emerald-coloured during the rains, and in the
heats a network of dry and broom-like twigs. Except
upon the banks of nullahs&mdash;“rivers” that are not rivers&mdash;the
trees, as in Ugogo, wanting nutriment, never afford
timber, and even the calabash appears stunted. The
trackless waste of scrub, called the “bush” in Southern
Africa, is found in places alternating with thin gum-forest;
the change may be accounted for by the different
depths of water below the level of the ground. It is a
hardy vegetation of mimosas and gums mixed with evergreen
succulent plants, cactaceæ, aloes, and euphorbias:
the grass, sometimes tufty, at other times equally spread,
is hard and stiff; when green it feeds cattle, and when dry
it is burned in places by passing caravans to promote the
growth of another crop.</p>

<p>The groundwork of Mgunda Mk’hali is a detritus of
yellowish quartz, in places white with powdered felspar,
and, where vegetation decays, brown-black with humus.
Water-worn pebbles are sprinkled over the earth, and
the vicinity of Fiumaras abounds in a coarse and modern
sandstone-conglomerate. Upon the rolling surface, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-283">[283]</span>
towering high above the tallest trees, are based the
huge granitic and syenitic outcrops before alluded to.
The contrast between the masses and the dwarf rises
which support them at once attracts the eye. Here and
there the long waves that diversify the land appear in
the far distance like blue lines bounding the nearer
superficies of brown or green. Throughout this rolling
table-land the watershed is to the south. In rare places
the rains stagnate in shallow pools, which become
systems of mud-cakes during the drought. At this
season water is often unprocurable in the Fiumaras,
causing unaccustomed hardships to caravans, and death
to those beasts which, like the elephant and the buffalo,
cannot long exist without drinking.</p>

<p>On the 20th October we began the transit of the
“Fiery Field,” whose long broad line of brown jungle,
painted blue by the intervening air, had, since leaving
K’hok’ho, formed our western horizon. The waste
here appeared in its most horrid phase. The narrow
goat-path serpentined in and out of a growth of
poisonous thorny jungle, with thin, hard grass-straw,
growing on a glaring white and rolling ground; the
view was limited by bush and brake, as in the alluvial
valleys of the maritime region, and in weary sameness
the spectacle surpassed everything that we had endured
in Marenga Mk’hali. We halted through the heat
of the day at some water-pits in a broken course; and
resuming our tedious march early in the afternoon, we
arrived about sunset at the bed of a shallow nullah,
where the pure element was found in sand-holes about
five feet deep.</p>

<p>On the 2nd day we reached the large Mabunguru
Fiumara, a deep and tortuous gash of fine yellow quartzoze
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-284">[284]</span>
sand and sunburnt blocks of syenite: at times it
must form an impassable torrent, even at this season of
severe drought it afforded long pools of infiltrated rain-water,
green with weeds and abounding with shell-fish,
and with the usual description of Silurus. In the
earlier morning the path passed through a forest already
beautified by the sprouting of tender green leaves and
by the blooming of flowers, amongst which was a large
and strongly perfumed species of jasmine, whilst young
grass sprouted from the fire-blackened remnants of the
last year’s crop. Far upon the southern horizon rose
distant hills and lines, blue, as if composed of solidified
air, and mocking us by their mirage-likeness to the
ocean. Nearer, the ground was diversified by those
curious evidences of igneous action, which extend westward
through eastern Unyamwezi, and northwards to
the shores of the Nyanza Lake. These outcrops of
gray granite and syenite are principally of two
different shapes, the hog’s back and the turret. The
former usually appears as a low lumpy dome of various
dimensions; here a few feet long, there extending a mile
and a half in diameter: the outer coat scales off under
the action of the atmosphere, and in places it is worn
away by a network of paths. The turret is a more
picturesque and changing feature. Tall rounded
blocks and conical or cylindrical boulders, here single,
there in piles or ridges, some straight and stiff as giant
ninepins, others split as if an alley or a gateway passed
between them, rise abruptly and perpendicularly almost
without foundationary elevation, cleaving the mould of
a dead plain, or&mdash;like gypseous formations, in which
the highest boulders are planted upon the lowest and
broadest bases&mdash;they bristle upon a wave of dwarfish
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-285">[285]</span>
rocky hill. One when struck was observed to give
forth a metallic clink, and not a few, balanced upon
points, reminded me of the tradition-bearing rocking
stones. At a distance in the forest, the larger masses
might be mistaken for Cyclopean walls, towers, steeples,
minarets, loggans, dwelling houses, and ruined castles.
They are often overgrown with a soft grass, which
decaying, forms with the degradation of the granite a
thin cap of soil; their summits are crowned with tufty
cactus, a stomatiferous plant which imbibes nourishment
from the oxygen of the air; whilst huge creepers,
imitating trees, project gnarled trunks from the deeper
crevices in their flanks. Seen through the forest these
rocks are an effective feature in the landscape, especially
when the sunbeams fall warm and bright upon
their rounded summits and their smooth sides, here
clothed with a mildew-like lichen of the tenderest leek-green,
there yellowed like Italian marbles by the burning
rays, and there streaked with a shining black as if
glazed by the rain, which, collecting in cupfuls upon the
steps and slopes, at times overflows, coursing in mimic
cataracts down the heights.</p>

<p>That march was a severe trial; we had started at dawn,
we did not, however, arrive at the Mabunguru Fiumara
before noon, and our people straggled in about eveningtide.
All our bullet-moulds, and three boxes of ammunition,
were lost. Said bin Salim, the Jemadar, and
three other men had followed in the rear, driving on the
“One-Eyed Fiend,” which, after many a prank, lay down
upon the ground, and positively declined to move. The
escort, disliking the sun, abandoned it at once to its fate,
and want of provisions, and the inordinate length of
the marches, rendered a halt or a return for the valuable
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-286">[286]</span>
load&mdash;four boxes of ammunition&mdash;out of the question.
An article once abandoned in these deserts is rarely
if ever recovered; the caravan-porters will not halt,
and a small party dares not return to recover it.</p>

<p>The 22nd October saw us at Jiwe la Mkoa, the half-way-house
of Mgunda Mk’hali. The track, crossing the
rough Mabunguru Fiumara, passed over rolling ground
through a thorny jungle that gradually thinned out into
a forest; about 8 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> a halt was called at a water in
the wilderness. My companion being no longer able to
advance on foot, an ass was unloaded, and its burden
of ammunition was divided, for facility of porterage,
amongst the sons of Ramji. After noon we resumed
our march, and the Kirangozi, derided by the rival
guide of the Coast-Arabs’ caravan, and urged forward
by Kidogo, who was burning to see his wife and children
in Unyamwezi, determined to “put himself at the head
of himself.” The jungle seemed interminable. The
shadows of the hills lengthened out upon the plains, the
sun sank in the glory of purple, crimson, and gold, and
the crescent-moon rained a flood of silvery light upon
the topmost twig-work of the trees; we passed a dwarf
clearing, where lodging and perhaps provisions were to
be obtained, and we sped by water near the road where
the frogs were chanting their vesper-hymn; still far,&mdash;far
ahead we heard the horns and the faint march-cries of
the porters. At length, towards the end of the march,
we wound round a fantastic mass of cactus-clad
boulders, and crossing a low ridge we found at its base
a single Tembe or square village of emigrant Wakimbu,
who refused to admit us. The little basin beyond it
displayed, by “black jacks” and felled tree-trunks,
evidences of modern industry, and it extended to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-287">[287]</span>
Jiwe or Rock, which gives its name to the clearing. We
were cheered by the sight of the red fires glaring in the
Kraal, but my companion’s ass, probably frightened by
some wild beast to us invisible, reared high in the air,
bucked like a deer, broke his frail Arab girths, and
threw his invalid rider heavily upon the hard earth.
Arrived at the Kraal, I found every boothy occupied by
the porters, who refused shelter until dragged out like
slaughtered sheep. Said bin Salim’s awning was as
usual snugly pitched; ours still lay on the ground.
The little Arab’s “duty to himself” appeared to attain
a higher limit every stage; once comfortably housed, he
never thought of offering cover to another, and his
children knew him too well even to volunteer such
a service to any one but himself. On a late occasion,
when our tent had not appeared, Said bin Salim, to
whom a message had been sent, refused to lend us one
half of the awning committed to him, a piece of canvas
cut out to serve as a tent and lug-sail. Bombay then
distinguished himself by the memorable words,&mdash;“If
you are not ashamed of your master, be ashamed of his
servant!” which had the effect of bringing the awning
and of making Said bin Salim testily refuse the half
returned to him.</p>

<p>Jiwe la Mkoa, or the Round Rock, is the largest
of the many hogs’-backs of grey syenite that stud
this waste. It measures about two miles in extreme
diameter, and the dome rises with a gentle slope
to the height of 200 or 300 feet above the dead level of
the plain. Tolerable water is found in pits upon a
swamp at its southern base, and well covered Mtego or
elephant traps, deep grave-like excavations, like the
Indian “Ogi,” prove dangerous to travellers; in one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-288">[288]</span>
these the Jemadar disappeared suddenly, as if by magic.
The smooth and rounded surface of the rock displays
deep hoof-shaped holes, which in a Moslem land would
at once be recognised as the Asr, or the footprints of
those holy quadrupeds, Duldul or Zu’l Jenah. In places
the Jiwe, overgrown with scattered tufts of white grass,
and based upon a dusty surface blackened by torrent
rains, forcibly suggested to the Baloch the idea of an
elderly negro’s purbald poll.</p>

<p>We encamped close to the Jiwe, and in so doing we did
wrong: however pleasant may be the shadow of a tall
rock in a thirsty land by day, way-wise travellers avoid
the vicinity of stones which, by diminished radiation,
retain their heat throughout the night. All caravans
passing through this clearing clamour to be supplied
with provisions; our porters, who, having received
rations for eight days, which they consumed in four,
were no exceptions to the rule. As the single little
village of Jiwe la Mkoa could afford but one goatskin
of grain and a few fowls, the cattle not being for
sale, and no calves having been born to the herds, the
porters proposed to send a party with cloth and beads
to collect provaunt from the neighbouring settlements.
But the notable Khalfan bin Khamis, the most energetic
of the Coast-Arabs in whose company we were travelling,
would brook no delay: he had issued as usual
three days’ rations for a long week’s march, and thus
by driving his porters beyond their speed, he practised a
style of economy usually categorised by us at home as
“penny-wise and pound-foolish.” His marching was
conducted upon the same principle; determining to save
time, he pushed on till his men began to flag, presently
broke down, and finally deserted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-289">[289]</span></p>

<p>At Jiwe la Mkoa the neck of the desert is broken:
the western portion of Mgunda Mk’hali has already
thinned out. On the 23rd October, despite the long
march of the preceding day, Khalfan proposed a Tirikeza,
declaring that the heavy nimbus from the west,
accompanied by a pleasant cold, portended rain, and
that this rain, like the “Choti Barsat” of India, announces
the approach of the great Masika, or vernal wet
season. Yielding to his reasons, we crossed the “Round
Rock,” and passing through an open forest of tall trees,
with here and there an undulating break, now yellow
with quartz, then black with humus, we reached, after
about three hours, another clearing like Jiwe la Mkoa,
which owes its origin to the requirements of commerce.
“Kirurumo” boasted of several newly built Tembe
of Wakimbu, who supplied caravans at an exorbitant
rate. The blackness of the ground, and the vivid
green of vegetation, evidenced the proximity of water.
The potable element was found in pits, sunk in a narrow
nullah running northwards across the clearing; it was
muddy and abundant. On the next day the road led
through a thin forest of thorns and gums, which, bare
of bush and underwood, afforded a broad path and
pleasant, easy travelling. Sign of elephant and rhinoceros,
giraffe and antelope, crossed the path, and as
usual in such places, the asses were tormented by the
Tzetze. After travelling four hours and thirty minutes,
we reached a new settlement upon the western frontier
of Uganzi, called “Jiweni,” “near the stones,” from
the heaps of block and boulder scattered round pits of
good water, sunk about three feet in the ground. The
Mongo Nullah, a deep surface-drain, bisects this clearing,
which is palpably modern. Many of the trees are
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-290">[290]</span>
barked previous to felling, and others have fallen prostrate,
apparently from the depredations of the white
ant. On the 25th, after another desert march of
2 hrs. 20′ through a flat country, where the forest
was somewhat deformed by bush and brake, which
in places narrowed the path to a mere goat-track,
we arrived at the third quarter of Mgunda Mk’hali.
“Mgongo T’hembo,” or the Elephant’s Back, derives
its name from a long narrow ridge of chocolate-coloured
syenite, outcropping from the low forest lands around
it; the crest of the chain is composed of loose rocks
and large detached boulders. Like the other inhabited
portions of Mgunda Mk’hali, it is a recent clearing;
numerous “black-jacks,” felled trees, and pollarded
stumps still cumber the fields. The “Elephant’s Back”
is, however, more extensive and better cultivated than
any of its neighbours,&mdash;Mdáburu alone excepted,&mdash;and
water being abundant and near the surface,
it supports an increasing population of mixed Wakimbu
and Wataturu, who dwell in large substantial
Tembe, and live by selling their surplus holcus, maize, and
fowls to travellers. They do not, like the Wakimbu of
Jiwe la Mkoa, refuse entrance to their villages, but they
receive the stranger with the usual niggard guest-rites of
the slave-path, and African-like, they think only of what
is to be gained by hospitality. Here I halted for a day to
recruit and to lay in rations. The length of the stages
had told upon the men; Bombay had stumped himself,
several of the sons of Ramji, and two of Said bin
Salim’s children were unable to walk; the asses, throwing
themselves upon the ground, required to be raised with
the stick, and all preferred rest even to food. Mboni,
one of the sons of Ramji, carried off a slave girl from
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-291">[291]</span>
the camp of the Coast-Arabs; her proprietor came armed
to recover her, swords were drawn, a prodigious clash
and clatter of tongue arose, friends interfered, and
blades were sheathed. Khalfan bin Khamis, losing all
patience at this delay, bade us adieu, promising to announce
our approach at Unyanyembe; about a week
afterwards, however, we found him in most melancholy
plight, halted half-way, because his over-worked porters
had taken “French leave.”</p>

<p>We resumed our march on the 27th October, and
after a slow and painful progress for seven hours over
a rolling country, whose soil was now yellow with argile,
then white with felspar, then black-brown with humus,
through thorny bush, and forest here opening out,
there densely closing in, we arrived at the “Tura Nullah,”
the deepest of the many surface drains winding
tortuously to the S. W. The trees lining the margin
were of the noblest dimensions; the tall thick grass that
hedged them in showed signs of extensive conflagration,
and water was found in shallow pools and in deep pits
beneath the banks, on the side to which the stream,
which must be furious during the rainy season, swings.
When halted in a clear place in the jungle, we were
passed by a down caravan of Wanyamwezi; our porters
shouted and rushed up to greet their friends, the men
raised their right hands about a dozen times, and then
clapped palm to palm, and the women indulged in
“vigelegele,” the African “lulliloo,” which rang like
breech-loaders in our ears.</p>

<p>On the next day we set out betimes through the
forest, which, as usual when nearing populous settlements,
spread out, and which began at this season to
show a preponderance of green over brown. Presently
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-292">[292]</span>
we reached a large expanse of yellow stover where the
van had halted, in order that the caravan might make
its first appearance with dignity. Ensued a clearing,
studded with large stockaded villages, peering over tall
hedges of dark green milk-bush, fields of maize and millet,
manioc, gourds, and water-melons, and showing numerous
flocks and herds, clustering around the shallow pits.
The people swarmed from their abodes, young and old
hustling one another for a better stare; the man forsook
his loom and the girl her hoe, and for the remainder
of the march we were escorted by a tail of screaming
boys and shouting adults; the males almost nude, the
women, bare to the waist and clothed only knee-deep in
kilts, accompanied us, puffing pipes the while, with
wallets of withered or flabby flesh flapping the air,
striking their hoes with stones, crying “Beads! beads!”
and ejaculating their wonder in strident explosions of
“Hi! hi!&mdash;Hui! ih!” and “Ha!&mdash;a!&mdash;a!” It was a
spectacle to make an anchorite of a man,&mdash;it was at
once ludicrous and disgusting.</p>

<p>At length the Kirangozi fluttered his red flag in the
wind, and the drums, horns, and larynxes of his followers
began the fearful uproar which introduces a
caravan to the admiring “natives.” Leading the way,
our guide, much to my surprise,&mdash;I knew not then that
such was the immemorial custom of Unyamwezi,&mdash;entered
uninvited and sans ceremony the nearest large
village; the long string of porters flocked in with bag and
baggage, and we followed their example. The guests
at once dispersed themselves through the several courts
and compounds into which the interior hollow was divided,
and lodged themselves with as much regard for
self and disregard for their grumbling hosts as possible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-293">[293]</span>
We were placed under a wall-less roof, bounded on one
side by the bars of the village palisade, and the mob of
starers that relieved one another from morning till night
made me feel like the denizen of a menagerie.</p>

<span class="chapname">THE GEOGRAPHY AND ETHNOGRAPHY OF UGOGO,&mdash;THE THIRD REGION.</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="noindent">The third division of the country visited is a flat table-land
extending from the Ugogi “Dhun,” or valley, at the
western base of the Wasagara Mountains, in E. long.
36° 14′, to Tura, the eastern district of Unyamwezi, in E.
long. 33° 57′; occupying a diagonal breadth of 155 geographical
rectilinear miles. The length from north to
south is not so easily estimated. The Wahumba and
the Wataturu in the former, and the Wahehe and
Warori in the latter direction, are migratory tribes that
spurn a civilised frontier; according to the Arabs, however,
the Wagogo extend three long marches on an
average to the north and four or five southwards. This,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-295">[295]</span>
assuming the march at 15 miles, would give a total of
120. The average of the heights observed is 3,650 feet,
with a gradual rise westwards to Jiwe la Mkoa, which
attains an altitude of 4,200 feet(?).</p>

<p>The third region, situated to leeward of a range
whose height compels the south-east trades to part with
their load of vapours, and distant from the succession
of inland seas, which, stationed near the centre of the
African continent, act as reservoirs to restore the
balance of humidity, is an arid, sterile land, a counterpart,
in many places, of the Kalahari and the Karroo,
or South African desert-plains. The general aspect is
a glaring yellow flat, darkened by long growths of
acrid, saline, and succulent plants, thorny bush, and
stunted trees, and the colouring is monotonous in the
extreme. It is sprinkled with isolated dwarf cones
bristling with rocks and boulders, from whose interstices
springs a thin forest of gums, thorns, and mimosas.
The power of igneous agency is displayed in protruding
masses of granitic formation, which rise from the dead
level with little foundationary elevation; and the masses
of sandstone, superincumbent upon the primitive base
in other parts of the country, here disappear. On the
north rises the long tabular range of the Wahumba
Hills, separated by a line of lower ground from the plateau.
Southwards, a plain, imperceptibly shelving, trends
towards the Rwaha River. There are no rivers in Ugogo:
the periodical rains are carried off by large nullahs,
whose clay banks are split and cut during the season of
potent heat into polygonal figures like piles of columnar
basalt. On the sparkling nitrous salinas and the dull-yellow
or dun-coloured plains the mirage faintly resembles
the effects of refraction in desert Arabia. The roads
are mere foot-tracks worn through the fields and bushes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-296">[296]</span>
The kraals are small dirty circles enclosing a calabash
or other tree, against which goods are stacked. The
boothies are made of dried canes and stubble, surrounded
by a most efficient <i>chevaux de frise</i> of thorn-boughs.
At the end of the dry season they are burnt down by
inevitable accident. The want of wood prevents their
being made solidly, and for the same reason “bois de
vache” is the usual fuel of the country.</p>

<p>The formation of the subsoil is mostly sandstone
bearing a ruddy sand. The surface is in rare places a
brown vegetable humus, extending but a few inches in
depth, or more generally a hard yellow-reddish ferruginous
clay covered with quartz nodules of many colours,
and lumps of carbonate of lime, or white and siliceous
sand, rather resembling a well-metalled road or an
“untidy expanse of gravel-walk” than the rich moulds
which belong to the fertile African belt. In many parts
are conical anthills of pale red earth; in others ironstone
crops out of the plain; and everywhere fine and
coarse grits abound. The land is in parts condemned
to perpetual drought, and nowhere is water either good
or plentiful. It is found in the serpentine beds of nullahs,
and after rain in ziwa, vleys, tanks, pools, or ponds,
filled by a gentle gravitation, and retained by a strong
clay, in deep pits excavated by the people, or in shallow
holes “crowed” in the ground. The supplies of this
necessary divide the country into three great districts.
On the east is Marenga Mk’hali, a thick bush, where a
few villages, avoided by travellers, are scattered north
and south of the road. The heart of the region is
Ugogo, the most populous and the best cultivated
country, divided into a number of small and carefully
cultivated clearings by tracts of dense bush and timberless
woods, a wall of verdure during the rains, and in
the hot season a system of thorns and broomwork which
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-297">[297]</span>
serves merely to impede a free circulation of the air.
These seams of waste land appear strange in a country
populated of old; the Arabs, however, declare that the land
is more thinly inhabited than it used to be. Mgunda
Mk’hali, the western division, is a thin forest and a heap
of brakey jungle. The few hills are thickly clothed
with vegetation, probably because they retain more
moisture than the plains.</p>

<p>The climate of Ugogo is markedly arid. During the
transit of the Expedition in September and October,
the best water-colours faded and hardened in their pans;
India-rubber, especially the prepared article in squares,
became viscid, like half-dried birdlime; “Macintosh”
was sticking plaister, and the best vulcanized elastic-bands
tore like brown paper. During almost the whole
year a violent east-wind sweeps from the mountains.
There are great changes in the temperature, whilst the
weather apparently remains the same, and alternate
currents of hot and cold air were observed. In the long
summer the climate much resembles that of Sindh;
there are the same fiery suns playing upon the naked
surface with a painful dazzle, cool crisp nights, and
clouds of dust. The succulent vegetation is shrivelled
up and carbonised by heat, and the crackling covering
of clayey earth and thin sand, whose particles are unbound
by dew or rain, rises in lofty whirling columns
like water-spouts when the north wind from the Wahumba
Hills meets the gusts of Usagara, which are
soon heated to a furnace-breath by the glowing surface.
These “p’hepo” or “devils” scour the plain with the
rapidity of horsemen, and, charged with coarse grain
and small pebbles, strike with the violence of heavy
hail. The siccity and repercussion of heat produce an
atmosphere of peculiar brilliancy in Ugogo: the milky
haze of the coast-climate is here unknown. The sowing
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-298">[298]</span>
season, at which time also trees begin to bud and birds
to breed, is about the period of the sun’s greatest
southern declination, and the diminution of temperature
displays in these regions the effects of the tepid
winds and the warm vernal showers of the European
continent. There is no Vuli, and thus the
climate is unrefreshed by the copious tropical rains.
About the middle of November the country is visited
by a few preliminary showers, accompanied by a violent
tramontana, and the vital principle which appears
extinct starts once more into sudden and excessive
activity. Towards the end of December the Masika, or
rainy season, commences with the wind shifting from
the east to the north and north-east, blowing steadily
from the high grounds eastward and westward of the
Nyanza Lake, which have been saturated by heavy falls
beginning in September. The “winter” seldom exceeds
the third month, and the downfall is desultory
and uncertain, causing frequent droughts and famine.
For this reason the land is much inferior in fertility to
the other regions, and the cotton and tobacco, which
flourish from the coast to the Tanganyika Lake, are
deficient in Ugogo, whilst rice is supplanted by the
rugged sorghum and maize.</p>

<p>Arab and other travellers unaccustomed to the
country at first suffer from the climate, which must
not, however, be condemned. They complain of the
tourbillons, the swarms of flies, and the violent changes
from burning heat to piercing cold, which is always experienced
in that region when the thermometer sinks
below 60°-55° F. Their thin tents, pitched under a
ragged calabash, cannot mitigate the ardour of an unclouded
sun; the salt-bitter water, whose nitrous and saline
deposits sometimes tarnish a silver ring like the
fumes of sulphur, affects their health; whilst the appetite,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-299">[299]</span>
stimulated by a purer atmosphere and the coolness of the
night air, is kept within due bounds only by deficiency
in the means of satisfying it. Those who have
seen Africa further west, are profuse in their praises of
the climate on their return-march from the interior.
The mukunguru, or seasoning fever, however, rarely
fails to attack strangers. It is, like that of the second
region, a violent bilious attack, whose consequences are
sleeplessness, debility, and severe headaches: the hot fit
compared with the algid stage is unusually long and rigorous.
In some districts the parexia is rarely followed
by the relieving perspiration; and when natural diaphoresis
appears, it by no means denotes the termination
of the paroxysm. Other diseases are rare, and the terrible
ulcerations of K’hutu and Eastern Usagara are almost
unknown in Ugogo. There is little doubt that the land,
if it afforded good shelter, purified water, and regular
diet, would be eminently wholesome.</p>

<p>In the uninviting landscape a tufty, straggling grass,
like living hay, often raised on little mounds, with bald
places between, thinly strewed with bits of quartz and
sandstone, replaces the tall luxuriant herbage of the
maritime plain, and the arboraceous and frutescent
produce of the mountains. The dryness of the climate,
and the poverty of the soil, are displayed in the larger
vegetation. The only tree of considerable growth is
the calabash, and it is scattered over the country widely
apart. A variety of frankincense overspreads the
ground; the bark is a deep burnished bronze, whitened
above with an incrustation, probably nitrous, that resembles
hoar-frost; and the long woody twigs are
bleached by the falling off of the outer integuments.
The mukl or bdellium tree rises like a dwarf calabash
from a low copse. The Arabs declare this produce of
Ugogo (<i>Balsamodendron Africanum?</i>), to be of good
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-300">[300]</span>
quality. Rubbed upon a stone and mixed with water
it is applied with a pledget of cotton to sluggish and
purulent sores; and women use it for fumigation.
The Africans ignore its qualities, and the Baloch,
though well acquainted with the bdellium, gugal, or
guggur, in their own country, did not observe it in
Ugogo. The succulent plants, cactus, aloe, and
euphorbia, will not burn; the air within them expands
with heat, and the juices gushing out extinguish the
flame. Amongst various salsolæ, or saltworts, the shrub
called by the Arabs arak, the Capparis Sodata of Sindh
and Arabia, with its currant-like bunches of fruit,
is conspicuous for its evergreen verdure; the ragged
and stunted mtungulu rains its apples upon the ground;
and the mbembu, in places sheltered from the sun, bears
a kind of medlar which is eagerly sought by the hungry
traveller. The euphorbiæ here rise to the height of
35 or 40 feet, and the hard woody stem throws out a
mass of naked arms, in the shape of a huge cap, impervious
to the midday sun.</p>

<p>Wild animals abound through these jungles, and the
spoor lasts long upon the crisp gravelly soil. In some
districts they visit by night the raised clay water-troughs
of the cultivators. The elephant prefers the thick jungle,
where he can wallow in the pools and feed delicately
upon succulent roots and fruits, bark, and leaves. The
rhinoceros loves the dark clumps of trees, which guard
him from the noonday sun, and whence he can sally out
all unexpected upon the assailant. The mbogo, or Bos
Caffer, driven from his favourite spots, low grassy plains
bordering on streams, wanders, like the giraffe, through
the thinner forests. As in Unyamwezi, the roar of the
lion strikes the ear by night, and the cry of the ostrich by
day. The lion upon this line of Eastern Africa is often
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-301">[301]</span>
heard, but rarely seen; on only two occasions its footprints
appeared upon the road. The king of beasts,
according to the Arabs, is of moderate stature: it
seldom attains its maximum of strength, stature, and
courage, except in plain countries where game abounds, as
in the lands north of the Cape, or in hills and mountains,
where cattle can be lifted at discretion, as in Northern
Africa. In Unyamwezi its spoils, which are yellow,
like those of the Arab lion, with a long mane, said to
hang over the eyes, and with a whitish tinge under the
jaws, become the property of the Sultan. The animal is
more common in the high lands of Karagwah than in the
low countries; it has, however, attacked the mbogo, or
wild bull, and has destroyed cattle within sight of the
Arabs at Kazeh in Unyanyembe. The lion is rarely a
man-eater; this peculiarity, according to some writers,
being confined to old beasts, whose worn teeth are unfit
for fight.</p>

<p>The “polygamous bird” was first observed on the
Ugogo plateau; it extends through Unyamwezi and
Usukuma to Ujiji. The eggs are sold, sometimes fresh,
but more generally stale. Emptied and dried, they
form the principal circulating-medium between the
Arab merchants and the coffee-growing races near the
Nyanza Lake, who cut them up and grind them into
ornamental disks and crescents. The young birds are
caught, but are rarely tamed. In Usukuma the bright
and glossy feathers of the old male are much esteemed
for adorning the hair; yet, curious to say, the bird is
seldom hunted. Moreover, these East Africans have
never attempted to export the feathers, which, when
white and uninjured, are sold, even by the Somal, for 8
dollars per lb. The birds are at once wild and stupid,
timid and headstrong: their lengthened strides and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-302">[302]</span>
backward glances announce terror at the sight of man,
and it is impossible to stalk them in the open grounds,
which they prefer. The leopard and the cynhyæna, the
koodoo and the different species of antelope, are more
frequently killed in these deserts than in any other part
of the line. Hog of reddish colour, and hares with
rufous fur, are sometimes started by caravans. The
hyrax of the Somali country basks upon the rocks and
boulders, and the carapace of a small land-turtle, called
khasa, fastened to a branch, serves as a road-sign. The
k’hwalu, a small green parrot, with yellow shoulders,
the upupa or hoopoe, a great variety of fly-catchers,
larks with jet-black heads and yellow bodies, small
bustards, hornbills, nightjars, muscicapæ, green pigeons,
sparrow-hawks, and small doves, are seen in every
jungle. Near the settlements the white-necked raven
and the common chíl of India (Falco cheela), attest the
presence of man, as the monkey does the proximity of
water. The nest of the loxia swings to and fro in the
fierce simoom; the black Bataleur eagle of Somaliland, a
splendid bird, towering shily in the air, with his light
under-plume gleaming like a silver plate, and large vultures
(condors?) flocking from afar, denote the position
of a dead or dying animal.</p>

<p>Until late years the Wagogo, being more numerous
than they are now, deterred travellers from traversing
their country: in those early days the road to Unyamwezi,
running along the left or northern bank of the
Rwaha, through the Warori tribe, struck off near
Usanga and Usenga. It is related, when the first caravan,
led by Jumah Mfumbi, the late Diwan of Saadani,
entered Ugogo, that the people, penetrated with admiration
of his corpulence, after many experiments to
find out whether it was real or not, determined that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-303">[303]</span>
was and must be the Deity. Moreover, after coming to
this satisfactory conclusion, they resolved that, being
the Deity, he could improve their country by heavy
rains; and when he protested against both these resolutions,
they proposed to put him to death. A succession
of opportune showers, however, released him. By degrees
the ever-increasing insolence and violence of the Warori
drove travellers to this northern line, and the Wagogo
learned to see strangers without displaying this Lybian
mania for sacrificing them.</p>

<p>Three main roads, leading from Western Usagara
westward, cross the Desert of Marenga Mk’hali. The
most northern is called Yá Nyiká&mdash;of the wilderness&mdash;a
misnomer, if the assertion of the guides be correct that
it is well watered, and peopled by the subjects of eight
sultans. The central line, described in the preceding
pages, is called, from its middle station, Marenga
Mk’hali: it is invariably preferred when water is scarce.
The southern road is termed Nyá Ngáhá, a continuation
of the Kiringwana route, previously alluded to: it has
provisions, but the people cause much trouble.</p>

<p>The superiority of climate, and probably the absence
of that luxuriant vegetation which distinguishes the
eastern region, have proved favourable to the physical
development of the races living in and about Ugogo.
The Wagogo, and their northern neighbours the Wahumba,
are at once distinguishable from the wretched
population of the alluvial valleys, and of the mountains
of Usagara; though living in lower altitudes, they are a
fairer race&mdash;and therefore show better blood&mdash;than the
Wanyamwezi. These two tribes, whose distinctness
is established by difference of dialect, will be described
in order.</p>

<p>The Wagogo extend from the landward base of Usagara
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-304">[304]</span>
in direct distance to Mdáburu a five days’ march:
on the north they are bounded by the Watáturu, on the
south by the Wabena tribes; the breadth of their country
is computed at about eight stages. In the north,
however, they are mingled with the Wahumba, in the
south-east with the Wahehe, and in the south with the
Warori.</p>

<p>The Wagogo display the variety of complexion usually
seen amongst slave-purchasing races: many of them are
fair as Abyssinians; some are black as negroes. In the
eastern and northern settlements they are a fine, stout,
and light-complexioned race. Their main peculiarity
is the smallness of the cranium compared with the
broad circumference of the face at and below the
zygomata: seen from behind the appearance is that of a
small half-bowl fitted upon one of considerably larger
bias; and this, with the widely-extended ears, gives
a remarkable expression to the face. Nowhere in
Eastern Africa is the lobe so distended. Pieces of cane
an inch or two in length, and nearly double the girth
of a man’s finger, are so disposed that they appear like
handles to the owner’s head. The distinctive mark of
the tribe is the absence of the two lower incisors; but
they are more generally recognised by the unnatural
enlargement of their ears&mdash;in Eastern Africa the “aures
perforatæ” are the signs, not of slavery, but of freedom.
There is no regular tattoo, though some of the women
have two parallel lines running from below the bosom
down the abdomen, and the men often extract only a
single lower incisor. The hair is sometimes shaved clean,
at others grown in mop-shape&mdash;more generally it is
dressed in a mass of tresses, as amongst the Egyptians,
and the skin, as well as the large bunch of corkscrews,
freely stained with ochre and micaceous earths, drips
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-305">[305]</span>
with ghee, the pride of rank and beauty. The Wagogo
are not an uncomely race: some of the younger women
might even lay claim to prettiness. The upper part of
the face is often fine, but the lips are ever thick, and
the mouth coarse; similarly the body is well formed to
the haunches, but the lean calf is placed peculiarly
high up the leg. The expression of the countenance,
even in the women, is wild and angry; and the round
eyes are often reddened and bleared by drink. The
voice is strong, strident, and commanding.</p>

<p>Their superiority of clothing gives the Wagogo, when
compared with the Wasagara or the Wanyamwezi, an
aspect of civilisation; a skin garment is here as rare as
a cotton farther west. Even the children are generally
clad. The attire of the men is usually some Arab
check or dyed Indian cotton: many also wear sandals
of single hide. Married women are clothed in “cloths
with names,” when wealthy, and in domestics when poor.
The dress of the maidens under puberty is the languti
of Hindostan, a kind of T-bandage, with the front ends
depending to the knees; it is supported by a single or
double string of the large blue glass-beads called Sungomaji.
A piece of coarse cotton cloth two yards long,
and a few inches broad, is fastened to the girdle
behind, and passing under the fork, is drawn tightly
through the waistbelt in front; from the zone the lappet
hangs mid-down to the shins, and when the wearer
is in rapid motion it has a most peculiar appearance.
The ornaments of both sexes are kitindi, and
bracelets and anklets of thick iron and brass-wires,
necklaces of brass chains, disks and armlets of fine
ivory, the principal source of their wealth, and bands
of hide-strip with long hair, bound round the wrists,
above the elbows, and below the knees: they value
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-306">[306]</span>
only the highest priced beads, coral and pink porcelains.
As usual the males appear armed. Some import
from Unyamwezi and the westward regions the
long double-edged knife called sime, a “serviceable
dudgeon” used in combat or in peaceful avocations,
like the snick-an-snee of the ancient Dutch. Shields
are unknown. The bow is long: the handle and the
horns are often adorned with plates of tin and zinc, and
the string is whipped round the extremities for strength.
The spear resembles that used by the Wanyamwezi in the
elephant-hunt: it is about four feet long, and the head is
connected with a stout wooden handle by an iron neck
measuring half the length of the weapon. In eastern
Ugogo, where the Masai are near, the Wagogo have
adopted their huge shovel-headed spears and daggers,
like those of the Somal. It is the fashion for men to
appear in public with the peculiar bill-hook used in
Usagara; and in the fields the women work with the
large hoe of Unyamwezi.</p>

<p>The villages of the Wagogo are square Tembe, low
and mean-looking for want of timber. The outer walls
are thin poles, planted in the ground and puddled with
mud. The huts, partitioned off like ships’ bunks, are
exceedingly dirty, being shared by the domestic animals,
dogs, and goats. They are scantily furnished with a
small stool, a cot of cow’s hide stretched to a small
framework, a mortar for grain, and sundry gourds
and bark corn-bins. About sunset all the population
retires, and the doors are carefully barricaded for fear
of the plundering Wahumba. At night it is dangerous
to approach the villages.</p>

<p>The language of Ugogo is harsher than the dialects
spoken by their eastern and western neighbours. In the
eastern parts the people understand the Masai tongue.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-307">[307]</span>
Many can converse fluently in the Kisawahili, or coast-tongue.
The people, however, despise all strangers
except the Warori and the Wahumba, and distinguish
the Wanyamwezi by the name of Wakonongo, which
they also apply to travellers in general. Within the
memory of man one Kafuke, of Unyamwezi, a great
merchant, and a Mtongi or caravan leader, when traversing
Ugogo with some thousands of followers, became
involved in a quarrel about paying for water. After
fifteen days of skirmishing, the leader was slain and the
party was dispersed. The effect on both tribes has
lasted to the present day. After the death of Kafuke
no rain fell for some years&mdash;a phenomenon attributed
by the Wagogo to his powers of magic; and the land
was almost depopulated. The Wanyamwezi, on the
other hand, have never from that time crossed the
country without fear and trembling. In the many wars
between the two tribes the Wagogo have generally
proved themselves the better men. This superiority
has induced a brawling and bullying manner. They
call themselves Wáná Wádege, or sons of birds&mdash;that
is to say, semper parati. The Wanyamwezi studiously
avoid offending them; and the porters will obey the
command of a boy rather than risk an encounter. “He
is a Mgogo,” said before the Bobadil’s face, makes him
feel himself forty times a man; yet he will fly in terror
before one of the Warori or the Wahumba.</p>

<p>The strength of the Wagogo lies in their comparative
numbers. As the people seldom travel to the coast,
their scattered villages are full of fighting men. Moreover,
Uchawi or black magic here numbers few believers,
consequently those drones of the social hive,
the Waganga, or medicine-men, are not numerous.
The Wagogo seldom sell their children and relations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-308">[308]</span>
yet there is no order against the practice. They barter
for slaves their salt and ivory, the principal produce of
the country. No caravan ever passes through the
country without investing capital in the salt-bitter substance
which is gathered in flakes efflorescing; from the
dried mud upon the surface of the Mbuga, or swampy
hollows; the best and the cheapest is found in the
district of Kanyenye. It is washed to clear it of dirt,
boiled till it crystallises, spread upon clean and smoothed
ground, and moulded with the hands into rude cones
about half a foot in length, which are bought at
the rate of 7-10 for a Shukkah, and are sold at a
high premium after a few days’ march. Ugogo supplies
western Usagara and the eastern regions of Unyamwezi
with this article. It is, however, far inferior to
the produce of the Rusugi pits, in Uvinza, which, on
account of its “sweetness,” finds its way throughout
the centre of Africa. Elephants are numerous in the
country: every forest is filled with deep traps, and
during droughthy seasons many are found dead in the
jungle. The country is divided into districts; the
tusks become the property of the Sultan within whose
boundaries the animal falls, and the meat is divided
amongst his subjects. Ivory is given in barter for slaves:
this practice assures to caravans a hold upon the people,
who, having an active commerce with the coast, cannot
afford to be shut out from it. The Wagogo are so greedy
of serviles that every gang leaves among them some of its
live stock&mdash;the principal want of the listless and indolent
cultivator. The wild captives bought in the interior,
wayworn and fond of change, are persuaded by a word to
desert; they take the first opportunity of slipping away
from their masters, generally stealing a weapon and a
little cloth or rations for immediate use. Their new
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-309">[309]</span>
masters send them off the road lest they should be
recognised and claimed: after a time a large hoe is
placed in their hands, and the fools feel, when too late,
that they have exchanged an easy for a hard life. The
Wagogo sell their fellow tribe-men only when convicted of
magic; though sometimes parents, when in distress, part
with their children. The same is the case amongst
their northern neighbours, the Wamasai, the Wahumba,
and the Wakwafi, who, however, are rarely in the
market, and who, when there, though remarkable for
strength and intelligence, are little prized, in consequence
of their obstinate and untameable characters;&mdash;many
of them would rather die under the stick
than level themselves with women by using a hoe.</p>

<p>The Wagogo are celebrated as thieves who will, like
the Wahehe, rob even during the day. They are importunate
beggars, who specify their long list of wants
without stint or shame; their principal demand is tobacco,
which does not grow in the land; and they resemble the
Somal, who never sight a stranger without stretching
out the hand for “Bori.” The men are idle and debauched,
spending their days in unbroken crapulence
and drunkenness, whilst the girls and women hoe the
fields, and the boys tend the flocks and herds. They
mix honey with their pombe, or beer, and each man
provides entertainment for his neighbours in turn.
After midday it would be difficult throughout the
country to find a chief without the thick voice, fiery
eyes, and moidered manners, which prove that he is
either drinking or drunk.</p>

<p>The Arabs declaim against the Wagogo as a “curst,”
ill-conditioned and boisterous, a violent and extortionate
race. They have certainly no idea of manners: they
flock into a stranger’s tent, squat before him, staring
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-310">[310]</span>
till their curiosity is satisfied, and unmercifully quizzing
his peculiarities. Upon the road a mob of both sexes will
press and follow a caravan for miles. The women, carrying
their babes in leopard-skins bound behind the back,
and with unveiled bosoms, stand or run, fiercely shouting
with the excitement of delight, and the girls laugh and
deride the stranger as impudently as boys would in more
modest lands. Yet, as has been said, this curiosity argues
to a certain extent improvability; the most degraded
tribes are too apathetic to be roused by strange sights.
Moreover, the Wagogo are not deficient in rude hospitality.
A stranger is always greeted with the “Yambo”
salutation. He is not driven from their doors, as
amongst the Wazaramo and Wasagara; and he is readily
taken into brotherhood. The host places the stool for
his guests, seating himself on the ground: he prepares
a meal of milk and porridge, and on parting presents,
if he can afford it, a goat or a cow. The African
“Fundi” or “Fattori” of caravans are rarely sober in
Ugogo. The women are well disposed towards strangers
of fair complexion, apparently with the permission of
their husbands. According to the Arabs, the husband
of the daughter is also <i>de jure</i> the lover of her mother.</p>

<p>The Sultan amongst the Wagogo is called Mtemi, a
high title. He exercises great authority, and is held in
such esteem by his people, that a stranger daring to
possess the same name would be liable to chastisement.
The ministers, who are generally brothers or blood-relations,
are known as Wázágíra (in the singular Mzágírá),
and the councillors, who are the elders and the
honourables of the tribe, take the Kinyamwezi title
“Wányápárá.”</p>

<p>The necessaries of life are dear in Ugogo. The people
will rarely barter their sheep, goats, and cows for plain
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-311">[311]</span>
white or blue cottons, and even in exchange for milk
they demand coral, pink, or blue glass beads. A moderate
sized caravan will expend from six to ten shukkah
per diem. The Wanyamwezi travelling-parties
live by their old iron hoes, for which grain is returned
by the people, who hold the metal in request.</p>

<p>The Wahumba, by some called Wahumpa, is one of
the terrible pastoral nations “beyond the rivers of
Æthiopia.” To judge from their dialect they are, like
the Wakwafi, a tribe or a subtribe of the great Masai
race, who speak a language partly South-African and
partly Semitico-African, like that of the Somal. The
habitat of the Wahumba extends from the north of
Usagara to the eastern shores of the Nyanza or Ukerewe
Lake; it has been remarked that a branch of the Mukondokwa
River rises in their mountains. The blue
highlands occupied by this pastoral race, clearly visible,
on the right hand, to the traveller passing from Ugogo
westwards, show where the ancient route from Pangani-town
used to fall into the main trunk-road of Unyamwezi.
Having but little ivory, they are seldom visited by
travellers: their country, however, was explored some
years ago by an Arab merchant, Hamid bin Salim, for
the purpose of buying asses. He set out from Tura, in
eastern Unyamwezi, and, traversing the country of the
wild Watatúru, arrived on the eighth day at the frontier
district I´ramba, where there is a river which separates
the tribes. He was received with civility; but
none have since followed his example.</p>

<p>The Wahumba are a fair and comely race, with the
appearance of mountaineers, long-legged, and lightly
made. They have repeatedly ravaged the lands of
Usagara and Ugogo: in the latter country, near
Usek’he, there are several settlements of this people,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-312">[312]</span>
who have exchanged the hide-tent for the hut, and the
skin for the cotton-cloth. They stain their garments
with ochreish earth, and their women are distinguished
by wearing Kitindi of full and half-size above and below
the elbows. The ear lobes are pierced and distended
by both sexes, as amongst the Wagogo. In their own
land they are purely pastoral; they grow no grain,
despise vegetable food, and subsist entirely upon meat
or milk according to the season. Their habitations
are hemispheres of boughs lashed together and roofed
with a cow’s hide; it is the primitive dwelling-place,
and the legs of the occupant protrude beyond the
shelter. Their arms, which are ever hung up close at
hand, are broad-headed spears of soft iron, long “Sine,”
or double-edged daggers, with ribbed wooden handles
fastened to the blade by a strip of cow’s tail shrunk on,
and “Rungu,” or wooden knob-kerries, with double
bulges that weight the weapon as it whirls through the
air. They ignore and apparently despise the bow and
arrows, but in battle they carry the Pavoise, or large
hide-shield, affected by the Kafirs of the Cape. The
Arabs, when in force, do not fear their attacks.</p>

<p>The Wahumba, like their congeners the Wakwafi,
bandage the infant’s leg from ankle to knee, and the
ligature is not removed till the child can stand upright.
Its object is to prevent the development of the calf,
which, according to their physiology, diminishes the
speed and endurance of the runner. The specimens of
Wahumba seen in different parts of Ugogo showed the
soleus and gastrocnemeius muscles remarkably shrunken,
and the projection of the leg rising close below the knee.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="noindent">The district of Tura, though now held, like Jiwe la
Mkoa and Mgongo T’hembo, by Wakimbu, is considered
the eastern frontier of Unyamwezi proper, which claims
superiority over the minor neighbouring tribes. Some,
however, extend the “land of the moon” eastward as
far as Jiwe la Mkoa, and the porters when entering the
“Fiery Field,” declare that they are setting foot upon
their own ground. The word “Tura,” pronounced by
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-314">[314]</span>
the Wanyamwezi “Tula” or “Itula,” means “put
down!” (scil. your pack): as the traveller, whether
from the east or from the west, will inevitably be delayed
for some days at this border settlement. Tula is
situated in S. lat. 5° 2′ and E. long. 33° 57′, and
the country rises 4,000 feet above sea level. After the
gloomy and monotonous brown jungles and thorn
forests of Mgunda Mk’hali, whose sinuous line of thick
jungle still girds the northern horizon, the fair champaign,
bounded on either hand by low rolling and
rounded hills of primary formation, with a succession of
villages and many a field of holcus and sesamum, maize,
millet, and other cereals, of manioc and gourds, water
melons and various pulses, delights the sight, and
appears to the African traveller a Land of Promise.</p>

<p>The pertinacious Kidogo pressed me to advance, declaring
the Wakimbu of Tura to be a dangerous race:
they appeared however a timid and ignoble people,
dripping with castor and sesamum oil, and scantily
attired in shreds of unclean cotton or greasy goat-skins.
At Tura the last of the thirty asses bought at
Zanzibar paid the debt of nature, leaving us, besides
the one belonging to the Jemadar, but three African
animals purchased on the road. A few extra porters
were therefore engaged. Our people, after the
discomforts of the bivouac, found the unsavoury village
a perfect paradise; they began somewhat prematurely
to beg for Bakhshish, and Muinyi Wazira requested
dismissal on the plea that a slave sent by him on a
trading-expedition into the interior had, by dying, endangered
the safety of the venture. On the morning of
the 30th October Kidogo led us over the plain through
cultivation and villages to another large settlement on
the western outskirt of the Tura district. As I disappointed
him in his hopes of a Tirikeza, he passed
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-315">[315]</span>
the night in another Tembe, which was occupied by the
caravans of Coast-Arabs and their slave girls, to one of
whom, said Scan. Mag., he had lost his heart, and he
punished me by halting through the next day. As we
neared the end of the journey the sons of Ramji
became more restive under their light loads; their dignity
was hurt by shouldering a pack, and day after day,
till I felt weary of life, they left their burdens upon
the ground. However, on the 1st November, they so
far recovered temper that the caravan was able to
cross the thin jungle, based upon a glaring white soil,
which divides the Tura from the Rubuga District.
After a march of 6 hrs. and 30′, we halted on the
banks of the Kwale or “Partridge” Nullah, where,
though late in the season, we found several long pools
of water. The porters collected edible bivalves and
caught a quantity of mud-fish by the “rough and ready”
African process, a waist-cloth tied to a pair of sticks,
and used by two men as a drag-net. At Rubuga,
which we reached in 5 hrs. and 45′, marching over
a plain of black earth, thinly garnished with grass
and thorn-trees, and then through clearings overgrown
with stubble, I was visited by an Arab merchant,
Abdullah bin Jumah, who, with a flying-caravan, had
left Konduchi on the coast 2 months and 20 days
after our departure. According to him his caravan had
lately marched thirty miles in the twenty-four hours:
it was the greatest distance accomplished in these regions;
but the Arabs are fond of exaggeration, the
party was small and composed of lightly laden men,
and moreover it required two days’ rest after so unusual
an exertion. This merchant unwittingly explained a
something which had puzzled me; whenever an advance
beyond Unyanyembe had been made the theme of conversation,
Said bin Salim’s countenance fell, and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-316">[316]</span>
dropped dark hints touching patience and the power of
Allah to make things easy. Abdullah rendered the expression
intelligible by asking me if I considered the
caravan strong enough to dare the dangers of the road&mdash;which
he grossly exaggerated&mdash;between Unyamwezi-Land
and Ujiji. I replied that I did, and that even if
I did not, such bugbears should not cause delay; Abdullah
smiled, but was too polite to tell me that he did
not believe me.</p>

<p>A “doux marcher” of 2 hrs. 40′ on the 3rd
November, led us to the western limit of the Rubuga
District. During the usual morning-halt under
a clump of shady milk-bush, I was addressed by
Maura or Maula, the Sultan of a large neighbouring
village of Wanyamwezi: being a civilised man and a
coast-traveller, he could not allow the caravan of the
“Wazungu” to pass his quarters without presenting to
him a bullock, and extracting from him a little cloth.
Like most chiefs in the “Land of the Moon,” he was a
large-limbed, gaunt, angular, tall old man, with a black
oily skin, seamed with wrinkles; and long wiry pigtails
thickened with grease, melted butter, and castor-oil, depending
from the sides of his purbald head. His dress&mdash;an
old Barsati round the loins, and a grimy Subai
loosely thrown over the shoulders&mdash;was redolent of
boiled frankincense; his ankles were concealed by a
foot depth of brass and copper “Sambo,” thin wires
twisted round a little bundle of elephant’s, buffalo’s,
or zebra’s hair; and he wore single-soled sandals,
decorated with four disks of white shell, about the size
of a crown-piece, bound to the thongs that passed between
the toes and girt the heel. He recognised the
Baloch, greeted all kindly, led the way to his village,
ordered lodgings to be cleared and cleaned, caused the
cartels or bedsteads,&mdash;the first seen by us for many
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-317">[317]</span>
months,&mdash;to be vacated, and left us to look for a bullock.
At the village door I had remarked a rude attempt at
fashioning a block of wood into what was palpably intended
for a form human and feminine; the Moslems of
course pronounced it to be an idol, but the people declared
that they paid no respect to it. They said the
same concerning the crosses and the serpent-like ornaments
of white ashes&mdash;in this land lime is unknown&mdash;with
which the brown walls of their houses were decorated.</p>

<p>We made bonne chère at Rubuga, which is celebrated
for its milk and meat, ghee and honey. On the wayside
were numerous hives, the Mazinga or “cannons,”
before described; here however they were raised out of
the reach of the ants, white and black, upon a pair of
short forked supports, instead of being suspended from
the branches of a tall tree. My companion brought
from a neighbouring swamp a fine Egyptian, or ruddy
goose, and a brace of crane-like water-fowl: these the
Wanyamwezi porters, expecting beef, disdained, because
rejected by the Baloch, yet at Inenge they had picked
the carcase of a way-spent ass. Presently we were
presented by the Sultan with one of the fattest of his
fine bulls; it was indeed</p>

<p class="noindent">withal, so violent and unmanageable that no man could
approach, much less secure it: it rushed about the village
like a wild buffalo, scattering the people, who all
fled except the Sultan, till it was stopped dead in a
most determined charge, with a couple of rifle-bullets,
by my companion. In return, Maula received a crimson
cloth and two domestics, after which he begged for
everything, including percussion caps, for which he had
no gun. He appeared most anxious to detain the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-318">[318]</span>
caravan, and in the evening his carefully concealed
reasons leaked out&mdash;he wanted me to cure his son of
fever, and to “put the colophon” upon a neighbouring
hostile chief. At 8 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, I was aroused by my gun-carrier,
Mabruki, who handed to me my Ferrara, and
by the Baloch Riza, who reported that the palisade
was surrounded by a host of raging blacks. I went
out into the village, where the guard was running about
in a state of excitement which robbed them of their
wits, and I saw a long dark line of men sitting silently
and peaceably, though armed for fight, outside the
strong stockade. Having caused our cloth to be safely
housed, and given orders to be awakened if work began,
I returned to the hut, determined to take leave of Sultan
Maura and his quarrels on the next day.</p>

<p>The porters were all gorged with beef, and three
were “stale-drunk” with the consequences of pombe;
yet so anxious were they rendered by the gathering
clouds, and the spitting showers to reach their homes
before the setting in of the “sowing rains,” that my task
was now rather to restrain than to stimulate their ardour:
the moon was resplendent, and had I wished it, they
would have set out at midnight. On the 4th November
we passed through another jungle-patch, to a village in
the fertile slopes of Ukona, where the Cannabis and the
Datura, with its large fetid flowers, disputed the ground
with brinjalls and castor-plants, holcus and panicum:
tobacco grew luxuriantly, and cotton-plots, carefully
hedged round against the cattle, afforded material for
the loom, which now appeared in every village.</p>

<p>On the next day, we passed out of the fertile slopes
of Ukona, and traversed an open wavy country,
streaked with a thin forest of Mimosa, the Mtogwe or
wood-apple, and a large quadrangular cactus. Beyond
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-319">[319]</span>
this point, a tract of swampy low level led to the
third district of Eastern Unyamwezi, called Kigwa, or
Mkigwa. We found quarters in a Tembe which was
half-burned and partly pulled down, to be re-erected.</p>

<p>The 6th November saw us betimes in the ill-omened
Forest, that divided us from the Unyanyembe district;
it is a thin growth of gum-trees, mimosas, and bauhinias,
with tiers, earth-waves, and long rolling lines of tawny-yellow
hill&mdash;mantled with umbrella-shaped trees, and
sometimes capped with blocks and boulders&mdash;extending
to a considerable distance on both sides. The Sultan
of Kigwa, one Manwa, has taken an active part in the
many robberies and murders which have rendered this
forest a place of terror, and the Arabs have hitherto
confined themselves to threats, though a single merchant
complains that his slave-caravans have at different
times lost fifty loads of cloth. Manwa is aided
and counselled by Mansur, a Coast-Arab, who, horse-whipped
out of the society of his countrymen at Kazeh,
for drunken and disorderly conduct, has become a
notorious traitor. Here also Msimbira, a Sultan of
the Wasukuma, or Northern Wanyamwezi, who has an
old and burning hatred against the Arabs, sends his
plundering parties. On the 6th November the Baloch
set out at 1 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>, we followed at 2.15 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>: they had been
prevented from obtaining beads on false pretences, consequently
they showed temper, and determined to deny
their escort. Their beards were now in my hand, they could
neither desert nor refuse to proceed, but they desired
to do me a harm, and they did it. During the transit
of the forest, an old porter having imprudently lagged
behind, was clubbed and cruelly bruised by three black
Mohawks, who relieved him of his load, a leathern portmanteau,
containing clothes, umbrellas, books, ink, journals,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-320">[320]</span>
and botanical collections. I afterwards heard that
the highwaymen had divided their spoils in the forest, and
that separating into two parties, they had taken the route
homewards. On the way, however, they were seized by
a plundering expedition sent by Kitambi, the Sultan of
Uyuwwi, a district half a day’s march <span class="smcapall">N.E.</span> from Kazeh.
The delict was flagrant; the head of one robber at once
decorated the main entrance of Kitambi’s village, but the
other two escaped Jeddart-justice with their share of the
plunder to his mortal enemy Msimbira. A present of a
scarlet waistcoat and four domestics recovered our clothes
from Kitambi; but Msimbira, threatening all the penalties
of sorcery, abused, plundered, and expelled Masud
ibn Musallam el Wardi, an old Arab merchant, sent to
him from Unyanyembe for the purpose of recovering
the books, journals, and collections. The perpetual
risk of loss discourages the traveller in these lands;
he never knows at what moment papers which have
cost him months of toil may be scattered to the winds.
As regards collections, future explorers are advised
to abandon the hope of making them on the march upwards,
reserving their labour for the more leisurely
return. The precautions with which I prefaced our
down-march may not be useless as suggestions. My
field and sketch-books were entrusted to an Arab merchant,
who preceded me to Zanzibar; they ran no
other danger except from the carelesness of the Consul
who, unfortunately for me, succeeded Lieut.-Col.
Hamerton. My companion’s maps, papers, and instruments,
were committed to a heavy “petarah,” a deal-box
with pent-lid and hide-bound as a defence against
rain, to be carried “Mziga-ziga,” as the phrase is&mdash;suspended
on a pole between the two porters least likely
to desert. I loaded one of the sons of Ramji with
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-321">[321]</span>
an enamelled leathern bag, converted from a dressing-case
into a protection for writing and sketching materials;
and a shooting-bag, hung during the march over
the shoulders of Nasiri, a Coast-Arab youth engaged as
ass-leader at Unyanyembe, contained my vocabularies,
ephemeris, and drawing-books.</p>

<p>Considering the conduct of the escort, I congratulated
myself upon having passed through the Kigwa forest
without other accident. Two or three days after our
arrival at Kazeh several loads of beads were plundered
from a caravan belonging to Abdullah bin Salih.
Shortly afterwards Msimbira sent a large foraging
party with a view to cutting off the road: they allowed
themselves to be surprised during sleep by Mpagamo’s
men, who slew twenty-five of their number and dispersed
the rest. This accident, however, did not cure
their propensity for pillage; on our return-march, when
halted at a village west of the Kigwa forest, a body of
slaves passed us in hot haste and sore tribulation: they
had that day been relieved by bandits of all their packs.</p>

<p>Passing from the Kigwa forest and entering the rice-lands
of the Unyanyembe district we found quarters&mdash;a
vile cow-house&mdash;in a large dirty village called Hanga.
The aspect of the land became prepossessing: the route
lay along a valley bisected by a little rivulet of sweet
water, whose course was marked by a vivid leek-green
line; the slopes were bright with golden stubble upon a
surface of well-hoed field, while to the north and south
ran low and broken cones of granite blocks and slabs,
here naked, there clothed from base to brow with dwarf
parasol-shaped trees, and cactaceæ of gigantic size.</p>

<p>From this foul village I was urged by Kidogo to conclude
by a tirikeza the last stage that separated the
caravan from Kazeh in Unyanyembe, the place which he
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-322">[322]</span>
and all around him had apparently fixed as the final
bourne of the exploration. But the firmament seemed on
fire, the porters were fagged, and we felt feverish,
briefly, an afternoon’s march was not judged advisable.
To temper, however, the wind of refusal, I served out
to each of the sons of Ramji five rounds of powder
for blowing away on entering the Arab head-quarters.
All of course had that private store which the Arabs
call “El Akibah”&mdash;the ending; it is generally stolen
from the master and concealed for emergencies with
cunning care. They had declared their horns to be
empty, and said Kidogo, “Every pedlar fires guns here&mdash;shall
a great man creep into his Tembe without a soul
knowing it?”</p>

<p>On the 7th November, 1857,&mdash;the 134th day from
the date of our leaving the coast&mdash;after marching at
least 600 miles, we prepared to enter Kazeh, the principal
Bandari of Eastern Unyamwezi, and the capital village
of the Omani merchants. We left Hanga at dawn.
The Baloch were clothed in that one fine suit without
which the Eastern man rarely travels: after a few displays
the dress will be repacked, and finally disposed of
in barter for slaves. About 8 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>, we halted for stragglers
at a little village, and when the line of porters becoming
compact began to wriggle, snake-like, its long
length over the plain, with floating flags, booming horns,
muskets ringing like saluting mortars, and an uproar of
voice which nearly drowned the other noises, we made
a truly splendid and majestic first appearance. The
road was lined with people who attempted to vie with
us in volume and variety of sound: all had donned
their best attire, and with such luxury my eyes had
been long unfamiliar. Advancing I saw several Arabs
standing by the wayside, they gave the Moslem salutation
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-323">[323]</span>
and courteously accompanied me for some distance.
Amongst them were the principal merchants, Snay bin
Amir, Said bin Majid, a young and handsome Omani of
noble tribe, Muhinna bin Sulayman, who, despite elephantiasis,
marched every year into Central Africa, and
Said bin Ali el Hinawi, whose short, spare, but well-knit
frame, pale face, small features, snowy beard, and bald
head, surmounted by a red fez, made him the type of
an Arab old man.</p>

<p>I had directed Said bin Salim to march the caravan
to the Tembe kindly placed at my disposal by Isá bin
Hijji, and the Arabs met at Inenge. The Kirangozi
and the porters, however, led us on by mistake (?) to the
house of “Musa Mzuri”&mdash;handsome Moses&mdash;an Indian
merchant settled at Unyanyembe for whom I bore an introductory
letter, graciously given by H. H. the Sayyid
Majid of Zanzibar. As Musa was then absent on a
trading-journey to Karagwah, his agent, Snay bin Amir,
a Harisi Arab, came forward to perform the guest-rites,
and led me to the vacant house of Abayd bin Sulayman
who had lately returned to Zanzibar.</p>

<p>After allowing me, as is the custom, a day to rest and
to dismiss the porters, who at once separated to their
homes, all the Arab merchants, then about a dozen,
made the first ceremonious call, and to them was officially
submitted the circular addressed by the Prince
of Zanzibar to his subjects resident in the African
interior. Contrary to the predictions of others, nothing
could be more encouraging than the reception experienced
from the Omani Arabs; striking, indeed, was
the contrast between the open-handed hospitality and
the hearty good-will of this truly noble race, and the
niggardness of the savage and selfish African&mdash;it was
heart of flesh after heart of stone. A goat and a load
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-324">[324]</span>
of the fine white rice grown in the country were the
normal prelude to a visit and to offers of service which
proved something more than a mere <i>vox et præterea nihil</i>.
Whatever I alluded to, onions, plantains, limes, vegetables,
tamarind-cakes, coffee from Karagwah, and
similar articles, only to be found amongst the Arabs,
were sent at once, and the very name of payment would
have been an insult. Snay bin Amir, determining to
surpass all others in generosity, sent two goats to us
and two bullocks to the Baloch and the sons of Ramji:
sixteen years before, he had begun life a confectioner
at Maskat, and now he had risen to be one of the
wealthiest ivory and slave-dealers in Eastern Africa.
As his health forbade him to travel he had become a
general agent at Kazeh, where he had built a village
containing his store-houses and his depôts of cloth
and beads, slaves and ivory. I have to acknowledge
many an obligation to him. Having received a “wakalat-namah,”
or “power of attorney” he enlisted
porters for the caravan to Ujiji. He warehoused my
goods, he disposed of my extra stores, and, finally, he
superintended my preparations for the down-march.
During two long halts at Kazeh he never failed, except
through sickness, to pass the evening with me, and from
his instructive and varied conversation was derived not
a little of the information contained in the following
pages. He had travelled three times between Unyamwezi
and the coast, besides navigating the great Lake
Tanganyika and visiting the northern kingdoms of Karagwah
and Uganda. He first entered the country about
fifteen years ago, when the line of traffic ended at
Usanga and Usenga, and he was as familiar with the
languages, the religion, the manners, and the ethnology
of the African, as with those of his natal Oman. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-325">[325]</span>
was a middle-aged man with somewhat of the Quixotic
appearance, high-featured, sharp and sunken-eyed,
almost beardless, light-coloured, tall, gaunt, and large-limbed.
He had read much, and, like an oriental, for
improvement, not only for amusement: he had a wonderful
memory, fine perceptions and passing power of
language. Finally, he was the stuff of which friends
are made; brave as all his race, prudent withal, ready
to perish for the “Pundonor,” and,&mdash;such is not often
the case in the East,&mdash;he was as honest as he was
honourable.</p>

<p>Before proceeding with the thread of my narrative,
the reader is requested to bear with the following few
lines upon the subject of Unyanyembe.</p>

<p>Unyanyembe, the central and principal province of
Unyamwezi, is, like Zungomero in Khutu, the great
Bandari or meeting-place of merchants, and the point of
departure for caravans which thence radiate into the
interior of Central Intertropical Africa. Here the Arab
merchant from Zanzibar meets his compatriot returning
from the Tanganyika Lake and from Uruwwa. Northwards
well-travelled lines diverge to the Nyanza Lake,
and the powerful kingdoms of Karagwah, Uganda, and
Unyoro; from the south Urori and Ubena, Usanga and
Usenga, send their ivory and slaves; and from the south-west
the Rukwa Water, K’hokoro, Ufipa, and Marungu
must barter their valuables for cottons, wires, and beads.
The central position and the comparative safety of Unyanyembe
have made it the head-quarters of the Omani
or pure Arabs, who, in many cases, settle here for years,
remaining in charge of their depôts, whilst their factors
and slaves travel about the country and collect the
items of traffic. At Unyanyembe the merchants expect
some delay. The porters, whether hired upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-326">[326]</span>
the coast or at the Tanganyika Lake, here disperse, and
a fresh gang must be collected&mdash;no easy task when the
sowing season draws nigh.</p>

<p>Unyanyembe, which rises about 3480 feet above sea-level,
and lies 356 miles in rectilinear distance from the
eastern coast of Africa, resembles in its physical features
the lands about Tura. The plain or basin of Ihárá, or
Kwihárá, a word synonymous with the “Bondei” or
low-land of the coast, is bounded on the north and
south by low, rolling hills, which converge towards the
west, where, with the characteristically irregular lay of
primitive formations, they are crossed almost at right
angles by the Mfuto chain. The position has been imprudently
chosen by the Arabs; the land suffers from
alternate drought and floods, which render the climate
markedly malarious. The soil is aluminous in the low
levels&mdash;a fertile plain of brown earth, with a subsoil of
sand and sandstone, from eight to twelve feet below the
surface; the water is often impregnated with iron, and
the higher grounds are uninhabited tracts covered with
bulky granite-boulders, bushy trees, and thorny shrubs.</p>

<p>Contrary to what might be expected this “Bandari-district”
contains villages and hamlets, but nothing that
can properly be termed a town. The Mtemi or Sultan
Fundikira, the most powerful of the Wanyamwezi chiefs,
inhabits a Tembe, or square settlement, called “Ititenya,”
on the western slope of the southern hills. A little
colony of Arab merchants has four large houses at a
neighbouring place, “Mawiti.” In the centre of the
plain lies “Kazeh,” another scattered collection of six
large hollow oblongs, with central courts, garden-plots,
store-rooms, and outhouses for the slaves. Around these
nuclei cluster native villages&mdash;masses of Wanyamwezi
hovels, which bear the names of their founders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-327">[327]</span></p>

<p>This part of Unyanyembe was first colonised about
1852, when the Arabs who had been settled nearly ten
years at Kigandu of P’huge, a district of Usukuma,
one long day’s march north of Kazeh, were induced by
Mpagamo, to aid them against Msimbira, a rival chief,
who defeated and drove them from their former seats.
The details of this event were supplied by an actor in
the scenes; they well illustrate the futility of the
people. The Arabs, after five or six days of skirmishing,
were upon the point of carrying the boma or
palisade of Msimbira, their enemy, when suddenly at
night their slaves, tired of eating beef and raw ground-nuts,
secretly deserted to a man. The masters awaking
in the morning found themselves alone, and made up
their minds for annihilation. Fortunately for them,
the enemy, suspecting an ambuscade, remained behind
their walls, and allowed the merchants to retire without
an attempt to cut them off. Their employer, Mpagamo,
then professed himself unable to defend them; when,
deeming themselves insecure, they abandoned his territory.
Snay bin Amir and Musa Mzuri, the Indian,
settled at Kazeh, then a desert, built houses, sunk wells,
and converted it into a populous place.</p>

<p>It is difficult to average the present number of Arab
merchants at Unyanyembe who, like the British in
India, visit but do not colonise; they rarely, however,
exceed twenty-five in number; and during the travelling
season, or when a campaign is necessary, they
are sometimes reduced to three or four; they are too
strong to yield without fighting, and are not strong
enough to fight with success. Whenever the people
have mustered courage to try a fall with the strangers,
they have been encouraged to try again. Hitherto
the merchants have been on friendly terms with Fundikira,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-328">[328]</span>
the chief. Their position, however, though
partly held by force of prestige, is precarious. They
are all Arabs from Oman, with one solitary exception,
Musa Mzuri, an Indian Kojah, who is perhaps
in these days the earliest explorer of Unyamwezi. In
July, 1858, an Arab merchant, Silim bin Masud, returning
from Kazeh to his home at Msene, with a slave-porter
carrying a load of cloth, was, though well armed
and feared as a good shot, attacked at a water in a strip
of jungle westward of Mfuto, and speared in the back
by five men, who were afterwards proved to be subjects
of the Sultan Kasanyare, a Mvinza. The Arabs organised
a small expedition to revenge the murder,
marched out with 200 or 300 slave-musketeers, devoured
all the grain and poultry in the country, and
returned to their homes without striking a blow, because
each merchant-militant wished his fellows to
guarantee his goods or his life for the usual diyat, or
blood-money, 800 dollars. This impunity of crime will
probably lead to other outrages.</p>

<p>The Arabs live comfortably, and even splendidly, at
Unyanyembe. The houses, though single-storied, are
large, substantial, and capable of defence. Their gardens
are extensive and well planted; they receive regular
supplies of merchandise, comforts, and luxuries from
the coast; they are surrounded by troops of concubines
and slaves, whom they train to divers crafts and callings:
rich men have riding-asses from Zanzibar, and
even the poorest keep flocks and herds. At Unyanyembe,
as at Msene, and sometimes at Ujiji, there are
itinerant fundi, or slave-artisans&mdash;blacksmiths, tinkers,
masons, carpenters, tailors, potters, and rope-makers,&mdash;who
come up from the coast with Arab caravans.
These men demand exorbitant wages. A broken
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-329">[329]</span>
matchlock can be repaired, and even bullets cast;
good cord is purchaseable; and for tinning a set of
seventeen pots and plates five shukkah merkani are
charged. A pair of Arab stirrups are made up for one
shukkah besides the material, and chains for animals at
about double the price. Fetters and padlocks, however,
are usually imported by caravans. Pack-saddles are
brought from Zanzibar: in caravans a man may sometimes
be found to make them. There is, moreover,
generally a pauper Arab who for cloth will make up
a ridge-tent; and as most civilised Orientals can use
a needle, professional tailors are little required. Provisions
are cheap and plentiful; the profits are large;
and the Arab, when wealthy, is disposed to be hospitable
and convivial. Many of the more prosperous merchants
support their brethren who have been ruined by the
chances and accidents of trade. When a stranger appears
amongst them, he receives the “hishmat l’il
gharíb,” or the guest-welcome, in the shape of a goat
and a load of white rice; he is provided with lodgings,
and is introduced by the host to the rest of the society
at a general banquet. The Arabs’ great deficiency is
the want of some man to take the lead. About fifteen
years ago Abdullah bin Salim, a merchant from Zanzibar,
with his body of 200 armed slaves, kept the
whole community in subjection: since his death, in
1852, the society has suffered from all the effects of disunion
where union is most required. The Arab, however,
is even in Africa a Pantisocrat, and his familiarity
with the inferior races around him leads to the proverbial
consequences.</p>

<p>The houses of the Arabs are Moslem modifications
of the African Tembe, somewhat superior in strength
and finish. The deep and shady outside-verandah,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-330">[330]</span>
supported by stout uprights, shelters a broad bench of
raised earthwork, where men sit to enjoy the morning
cool and the evening serenity, and where they pray,
converse, and transact their various avocations. A
portcullis-like door, composed of two massive planks,
with chains thick as a ship’s cable&mdash;a precaution rendered
necessary by the presence of wild slaves&mdash;leads
into the barzah, or vestibule. The only furniture is a
pair of clay benches extending along the right and left
sides, with pillow-shaped terminations of the same
material; over these, when visitors are expected, rush
mats and rugs are spread. From this barzah a passage,
built at the angle proper to baffle the stranger’s curiosity,
leads into the interior, a hollow square or oblong,
with the several rooms opening upon a courtyard,
which, when not built round, is completely closed by a
“liwan”&mdash;a fence of small tree-trunks or reeds. The
apartments have neither outward doors nor windows:
small bull’s-eyes admit the air, and act as loop-holes in
case of need. The principal room on the master’s side
of the house has a bench of clay, and leads into a dark
closet where stores and merchandise are placed. There
are separate lodgings for the harem, and the domestic
slaves live in barracoons or in their own outhouses.
This form of Tembe is perhaps the dullest habitation
ever invented by man. The exterior view is carefully
removed from sight, and the dull, dirty courtyard, often
swamped during the rains, is ever before the tenant’s
eyes; the darkness caused by want of windows painfully
contrasts with the flood of sunshine pouring in through
the doors, and at night no number of candles will light
up its gloomy walls of grey or reddish mud. The
breeze is either excluded by careless frontage, or the
high and chilling winds pour in like torrents; the roof
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-331">[331]</span>
is never water-tight, and the walls and rafters harbour
hosts of scorpions and spiders, wasps and cockroaches.
The Arabs, however, will expend their time and trouble
in building rather than trust their goods in African
huts, exposed to thieves and to the frequent fires which
result from barbarous carelessness: everywhere, when a
long halt is in prospect, they send their slaves for wood
to the jungle, and superintend the building of a spacious
Tembe. They neglect, however, an important precaution,
a sleeping-room raised above the mean level of malaria.</p>

<p>Another drawback to the Arab’s happiness is the
failure of his constitution: a man who escapes illness
for two successive months boasts of the immunity; and,
as in Egypt, no one enjoys robust health. The older
residents have learned to moderate their appetites.
They eat but twice a-day&mdash;after sunrise, and at noon&mdash;the
midday meal concluded, they confine themselves to
chewing tobacco or the dried coffee of Karagwah. They
avoid strong meats, especially beef and game, which are
considered heating and bilious, remaining satisfied with
light dishes, omelets and pillaus, harísah, firni, and
curded milk, and the less they eat the more likely they
are to escape fever. Harisáh, in Kisawahili “boko-boko,”
is the roast beef&mdash;the <i>plat de résistance</i>&mdash;of the
Eastern and African Arab. It is a kind of pudding
made with finely shredded meat, boiled with flour of
wheat, rice, or holcus, to the consistence of a thick
paste, and eaten with honey or sugar. Firni, an Indian
word, is synonymous with the muhallibah of Egypt, a
thin jelly of milk-and-water, honey, rice-flour, and spices,
which takes the place of our substantial northern rice-pudding.
The general health has been improved by the
importation from the coast of wheat, and a fine white
rice, instead of the red aborigen of the country, of various
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-332">[332]</span>
fruits, plantains, limes, and papaws; and of vegetables,
brinjalls, cucumbers, and tomatos, which relieve
the indigenous holcus and maize, manioc and sweet-potato,
millet and phaseoli, sesamum and ground-nuts.
They declare to having derived great benefit from the
introduction of onions,&mdash;an antifebral, which flourishes
better in Central than in Maritime Africa. The onion,
so thriving in South Africa, rapidly degenerates upon
the island of Zanzibar into a kind of houseleek. In
Unyamwezi it is of tolerable size and flavour. It enters
into a variety of dishes, the most nauseous being probably
the sugared onion-omelet. In consequence of general
demand, onions are expensive in the interior; an indigo-dyed
shukkah will purchase little more than a pound.
When the bulbs fail, the leaves chopped into thin circles
and fried in clarified butter with salt, are eaten as
a relish with meat. They are also inserted into marak
or soups, to disguise the bitter and rancid taste of
stale ghee. Onions may be sown at all seasons except
during the wet monsoon, when they are liable to decay.
The Washenzi have not yet borrowed this excellent
and healthy vegetable from the Arabs. Garlic has
also been tried in Unyanyembe, but with less success;
moreover, it is considered too heating for daily
use. As might be expected, however, amongst a floating
population with many slaves, foreign fruits and
vegetables are sometimes allowed to die out. Thus
some enterprising merchant introduced into Unyanyembe
the date and the mkungu, bidam, or almond-tree
of the coast: the former, watered once every third
day, promised to bear fruit, when, in the absence of
the master, the Wanyamwezi cut up the young shoots
into walking-sticks. Sugar is imported: the water-wanting
cane will not thrive in arid Unyanyembe, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-333">[333]</span>
honey must be used as a succedaneum. Black pepper,
universally considered cooling by Orientals, is much
eaten with curry-stuffs and other highly-seasoned
dishes, whereas the excellent chillies and bird-pepper,
which here grow wild, are shunned for their heating
properties. Butter and ghee are made by the wealthy;
humbler houses buy the article, which is plentiful and
good, from the Wanyamwezi. Water is the usual
beverage. Some Arabs drink togwa, a sweet preparation
of holcus; and others, debauchees, indulge in the
sour and intoxicating pombe, or small-beer.</p>

<p>The market at Unyanyembe varies greatly according
to the quantity of the rains. As usual in barbarous
societies, a dry season, or a few unexpected
caravans, will raise the prices, even to trebling; and
the difference of value in grain before and after the
harvest will be double or half of what it is at par. The
price of provisions in Unyamwezi has increased inordinately
since the Arabs have settled in the land. Formerly
a slave-boy could be purchased for five fundo, or
fifty strings of beads: the same article would now fetch
three hundred. A fundo of cheap white porcelain-beads
would procure a milch cow; and a goat, or ten hens its
equivalent, was to be bought for one khete. In plentiful
years Unyanyembe is, however, still the cheapest country
in East Africa, and, as usual in cheap countries, it
induces the merchant to spend more than in the dearest.
Paddy of good quality, when not in demand, sells at
twenty kayla (120lbs.) for one shukkah of American domestics;
maize, at twenty-five; and sorghum, here the
staff of life, when in large stock, at sixty. A fat bullock
may be bought for four domestics, a cow costs from
six to twelve, a sheep or a goat from one to two.
A hen, or its equivalent, four or five eggs, is worth
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-334">[334]</span>
one khete of coral or pink porcelain beads. One fundo
of the same will purchase a large bunch of plantains,
with which máwá or plantain-wine, and siki or vinegar
are made; and the Wanyamwezi will supply about a
pint of milk every morning at the rate of one shukkah
per mensem. A kind of mud-fish is caught by the
slaves in the frequent pools which, during the cold
season, dot the course of the Gombe Nullah, lying three
miles north of Kazeh; and return-caravans often bring
with them stores of the small fry, called Kashwá or
Daga’a, from the Tanganyika Lake.</p>

<p>From Unyanyembe twenty marches, which are seldom
accomplished under twenty-five days, conduct the traveller
to Ujiji, upon the Tanganyika. Of these the
fifth station is Msene, the great Bandari of Western
Unyamwezi. It is usually reached in eight days; and
the twelfth is the Malagarazi River, the western limit
of the fourth region.</p>

<p>The traveller, by means of introductory letters to the
Doyen of the Arab merchants at Kazeh, can always
recruit his stock of country currency,&mdash;cloth, beads, and
wire,&mdash;his requirements of powder and ball, and his supply
of spices, comforts, and drugs, without which travel
in these lands usually ends fatally. He will pay, it is
true, about five times their market-value at Zanzibar:
sugar, for instance, sells at its weight in ivory, or nearly
one-third more than its weight in beads. But though
the prices are exorbitant they preserve the buyer from
greater evils, the expense of porterage, the risk of loss,
and the trouble and annoyance of personally superintending
large stores in a land where “vir” and “fur”
are synonymous terms.</p>

<p>And now comfortably housed within a stone-throw of
my new friend Shaykh Snay bin Amir, I bade adieu for
a time to the march, the camp, and the bivouac. Perhaps
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-335">[335]</span>
the reader may not be unwilling to hear certain details
concerning the “road and the inn” in Eastern Africa;
he is familiar from infancy with the Arab Kafilah and
its host of litters and camels, horses, mules, and asses,
but the porter-journeys in Eastern Africa have as yet
escaped the penman’s pen.</p>

<p>Throughout Eastern Africa made roads, the first test
of progress in a people, are unknown. The most frequented
routes are foot-tracks like goat-walks, one to
two spans broad, trodden down during the travelling
season by man and beast, and during the rains the path
in African parlance “dies,” that is to say, it is overgrown
with vegetation. In open and desert places four
or five lines often run parallel for short distances. In
jungly countries they are mere tunnels in thorns and
under branchy trees, which fatigue the porter by catching
his load. Where fields and villages abound they
are closed with rough hedges, horizontal tree-trunks, and
even rude stockades, to prevent trespassing and pilferage.
Where the land is open, an allowance of one-fifth
must be made for winding: in closer countries
this must be increased to two-fifths or to one-half, and
the traveller must exercise his judgment in distributing
the marches between these two extremes. In Uzaramo
and K’hutu the tracks run through tall grasses, which
are laid by their own weight after rains, and are burned
down during the hot seasons: they often skirt cultivated
lands, which they are not allowed to enter, miry swamps
are spanned, rivers breast-deep, with muddy bottoms and
steep slippery banks, are forded, whilst deep holes, the
work of rodents and insects, render them perilous to
ridden cattle. In Usagara the gradients are surmounted
either by beds of mountain torrents or by breasting
steep and stony hills, mere ladders of tree-root and
loose stones: laden animals frequently cannot ascend
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-336">[336]</span>
or descend them. The worst paths in this region are
those which run along the banks of the many streams
and rivulets, and which traverse the broken and thorny
ground at the base of the hills. The former are
“thieves’ roads,” choked with long succulent grass
springing from slushy mud; the latter are continued
rises and falls, with a small but ragged and awkward
watercourse at every bottom. From Usagara to Western
Unyamwezi the roads lead through thick thorn-jungle,
and thin forests of trees blazed or barked along the
track, without hill, but interrupted during the rains by
swamps and bogs. They are studded with sign-posts,
broken pots and gourds, horns and skulls of game and
cattle, imitations of bows and arrows pointing towards
water, and heads of holcus. Sometimes a young tree
is bent across the path and provided with a cross-bar;
here is a rush gateway like the yoke of the ancients, or
a platform of sleepers supported by upright trunks; there
a small tree felled and replanted, is tipped with a crescent
of grass twisted round with bark, and capped with huge
snail shells, and whatever barbarous imagination may
suggest. Where many roads meet, those to be avoided
are barred with a twig or crossed by a line drawn with
the foot. In Western Uvinza and near Ujiji, the paths
are truly vile, combining all the disadvantages of bog
and swamp, river and rivulet, thorn-bush and jungle,
towering grasses, steep inclines, riddled surface, and
broken ground. The fords on the whole line are temporary
as to season, but permanent in place: they are rarely
more than breast-deep; and they average in dry weather
a cubit and a half, the fordable medium. There are
but two streams, the Mgeta and the Ruguvu, which are
bridged over by trees; both could be forded higher up
the bed; and on the whole route there is but one river,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-337">[337]</span>
the Malagarazi, which requires a ferry during the dry
season. Cross roads abound in the populous regions.
Where they exist not, the jungle is often impassable,
except to the elephant and the rhinoceros: a company
of pioneers would in some places require a week to cut
their way for a single march through the network
of thorns and the stockade of rough tree-trunks. The
directions issued to travellers about drawing off their
parties for safety at night to rising grounds, will not
apply to Eastern Africa; it would be far easier to dig
for themselves abodes under the surface.</p>

<p>It is commonly asserted in the island of Zanzibar
that there are no caravans in these regions. The dictum
is true if the term be limited to the hosts of
camels and mules that traverse the deserts and the
mountains of Arabia and Persia. It is erroneous if
applied to a body of men travelling for commercial
purposes. From time immemorial the Wanyamwezi
have visited the road to the coast, and though wars and
blood-feuds may have temporarily closed one line,
another necessarily opened itself. Amongst a race so
dependent for comfort and pleasure upon trade, commerce,
like steam, cannot be compressed beyond a certain
point. Until a few years ago, when the extension
of traffic induced the country people to enlist as porters,
all merchants traversed these regions with servile gangs
hired on the coast or island of Zanzibar, a custom still
prevailing on the northern and southern routes from
the sea-board to the lakes of Nyanza and Nyassa. Porterage,
on the long and toilsome journey, is now considered
by the Wanyamwezi a test of manliness, as the
Englishman deems a pursuit or a profession necessary
to clear him from the charge of effeminacy. The
children imbibe the desire with their milk, and at six
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-338">[338]</span>
or seven years old they carry a little tusk on their
shoulders&mdash;instinctive porters, as pointer-pups are
hereditary pointers. By premature toil their shinbones
are sometimes bowed to the front like those of
animals too early ridden. “He sits in hut egg-hatching,”
is their proverbial phrase to express one more
<span class="nowrap">elegant&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="noindent">And they are ever quoting the adage that men who
travel not are void of understanding&mdash;the African
equivalent of what was said by the European sage:
“The world is a great book, of which those who never
leave home read but a page.” Against this traditional
tendency reasons of mere hire and rations, though apparently
weighty, are found wanting. The porter will
bargain over his engagement to the utmost bead, saying
that all men are bound to make the best conditions for
themselves: yet, after two or three months of hard
labour, if he chance upon a caravan returning to his
home, a word from a friend, acting upon his innate debility
of purpose, will prevail upon him to sacrifice by
desertion all the fruits of his toil. On these occasions
the porters are carefully watched; open desertion would,
it is true, be condemned by the general voice, yet no
merchant can so win the affections of his men that some
will not at times disappear. Until the gangs have left
their homes far behind, their presence seems to hang by
a thread; at the least pretext they pack up their goods
and vanish in a mass. When approaching their settlements&mdash;at
the frontier districts of Tura and Mfuto, for
instance&mdash;their cloth and hire are taken from them,
packed in the employer’s bales, and guarded by armed
slaves, especially at night, and on the line of march.
Yet these precautions frequently fail, and, once beyond
the camp limits, it is vain to seek the fugitive. In the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-339">[339]</span>
act of desertion they show intelligence: they seldom
run away when caravans first meet, lest their employer
should halt and recover them by main force, and, except
where thieves and wild beasts are unknown, they
will not fly by night. The porter, however, has one
point of honour; he leaves his pack behind him. The
slave, on the other hand, certainly robs his employer
when he runs away, and this, together with his unwillingness
to work and the trouble and annoyance which
he causes to his owner, counterbalances his superior
dexterity and intelligence.</p>

<p>Caravans, called in Kisawahili safári (from the Arab
safar, a journey) and by the African rugendo or lugendo,
“a going,” are rarely wanting on the main trunk-lines.
The favourite seasons for the upward-bound are the
months in which the greater and the lesser Masika or
tropical rains conclude&mdash;in June and September, for
instance, on the coast&mdash;when water and provisions are
plentiful. Those who delay till the dry weather has
set in must expect hardships on the march; the expense
of rations will be doubled and trebled, and the
porters will frequently desert. The down-caravans set
out in all seasons except the rainy; it is difficult to
persuade the people of Unyanyembe to leave their fields
between the months of October and May. They will
abandon cultivation to the women and children, and
merrily take the footpath way if laden with their own
ivory, but from the merchant they will demand exorbitant
wages, and even then they will hesitate to engage
themselves.</p>

<p>Porterage varies with every year and in every caravan.
It knows but two limits: the interest of the
employer to disburse as little as possible by taking
every advantage of the necessities of his employé, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-340">[340]</span>
the desire of the employé to extract as much as he
can by presuming upon the wants of his employer.
In some years there is a glut of porters on the coast;
when they are rare quarrels take place between the
several settlements, each attempting a monopoly of
enlistment to the detriment of its neighbours, and a
little blood is sometimes let. When the Wanyamwezi
began to carry, they demanded for a journey from
the coast to their own country six to nine dollars’
worth of domestics, coloured cloths, brass-wires, and
the pigeon’s-egg bead called sungomaji. The rate of
porterage then declined; the increase of traffic, however,
has of late years greatly increased it. In 1857 it
was 10 dollars, and it afterwards rose to 12 dollars per
porter. In this sum rations are not included; the
value of these&mdash;which by ancient custom are fixed at 1
kubabah (about 1·5 lbs.) of grain per diem, or, that
failing, of manioc, sweet potatoes, and similar articles,
with the present of a bullock at the frontier&mdash;is subject
to greater variations, and is even less reducible to an
average than the porter’s pay. It is needless to say
that the down-journey is less expensive than the up-march,
as the carriers rely upon a fresh engagement on
the coast. The usual hire from Unyanyembe would be
nine cloths, payable on arrival at the sea-port, where
each is worth 25 cents, or about 1 shilling. The Arabs
roughly calculate&mdash;the errors balancing one another&mdash;that,
rations included, the hire of a porter from the
coast to the Tanganyika Lake and back amounts to a
total of 20 dollars = 4<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> From the coast, Wanyamwezi
porters will not engage themselves for a
journey westward of their own country; at Unyanyembe
they break up, and a fresh gang must be enlisted
for a march to the Tanganyika or to the Nyanza Lake.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-341">[341]</span>
It is impossible to average the numbers of an East
African caravan, which varies from half a dozen to 200
porters, under a single Mundewa or merchant. In
dangerous places travellers halt till they form an
imposing force; 500 is a frequent figure, and even
bodies of 1000 men are not rare. The only limit to
the gathering is the incapability of the country to fill
more than a certain number of mouths. The larger
caravans, however, are slow and cumbrous, and in places
they exhaust the provision of water.</p>

<p>Caravans in East Africa are of three kinds. The
most novel and characteristic are those composed only
of Wanyamwezi; secondly, are the caravans directed
and escorted by Wasawahili freemen or fundi (slave
fattori), commissioned by their patrons; and, lastly,
those commanded by Arabs.</p>

<p>The porter, called pagazi or fagazi&mdash;the former is
the African, the latter the ridiculous Arabised form of
the word&mdash;corresponds with the carregador of West
Africa. The Wanyamwezi make up large parties of
men, some carrying their own goods, others hired by
petty proprietors, who for union and strength elect a
head Mtongi, Ras Kafilah, or leader. The average
number of these parties that annually visit the coast is
far greater than those commanded by stranger-merchants.
In the Unyamwezi caravan there is no desertion,
no discontent, and, except in certain spots, little
delay. The porters trudge from sunrise to 10 or 11 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>,
and sometimes, though rarely, they will travel twice a
day, resting only during the hours of heat. They work
with a will, carrying uncomplainingly huge tusks, some
so heavy that they must be lashed to a pole between
two men&mdash;a contrivance technically called mziga-ziga.
Their shoulders are often raw with the weight, their
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-342">[342]</span>
feet are sore, and they walk half or wholly naked to
save their cloth for displays at home. They ignore
tent or covering, and sleep on the ground; their only
supplies are their country’s produce, a few worn-down
hoes, intended at times to purchase a little grain or to
be given as blackmail for sultans, and small herds of
bullocks and heifers that serve for similar purposes if
not lost, with characteristic African futility, upon the
road. Those who most consult comfort carry, besides
their loads and arms, a hide for bedding, an earthen
cooking pot, a stool, a kilindo or bark-box containing
cloth and beads, and perhaps a small gourd full of ghee.
They sometimes suffer severely from exposure to a
climate which forbids long and hard work upon short
and hard fare. Malignant epidemics, especially small-pox,
often attack caravans as they approach the coast;
generally, however, though somewhat lean and haggard,
the porters appear in better condition than might be
expected. The European traveller will repent accompanying
these caravans: as was said of a similar race,
the Indians of Guiana, “they will not deviate three
steps from the regular path.”</p>

<p>Porters engaged by Arab Mtajiri or Mundewa&mdash;the
former is the Kisawahili, the latter is the Inner African
term for a merchant or travelling trader&mdash;are known by
their superior condition; they eat much more, work much
less, and give far greater trouble to their commanders.
They expend part of the cloth and beads which they
have received as hire to procure for themselves occasional
comforts; and on the down-journey they take with
them a few worn-down hoes to retain the power of
desertion without starving. The self-willed wretches
demean themselves with the coolest impudence; reply imperiously,
lord it over their leaders, regulate the marches
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-343">[343]</span>
and the halts, and though they work they never work
without loud complaints and open discontent. Rations
are a perpetual source of heart-burning: stinted at
home to a daily mess of grain-porridge, the porters on
the line of march devote, in places where they can presume,
all their ingenuity to extort as much food as
possible from their employers. At times they are
seized with a furore for meat. When a bullock is
slaughtered, the Kirangozi or guide claims the head,
leaving the breast and loin to the Mtongi or principal
proprietor, and the remainder is equally portioned
amongst the khambi or messes into which the gang
divides itself. As has been remarked, the Arab merchant,
next to the Persian, is the most luxurious
traveller in the East; a veteran of the way, he well
knows the effects of protracted hardship and scarcity
upon a wayfarer’s health. The European traveller,
however, will not enjoy the companionship of the Arab
caravan, which marches by instinct rather than by
reason. It begins by dawdling over the preliminaries;
it then pushes hurriedly onwards till arrested by epidemic
or desertion; and finally it lingers over the end
of the journey, thus loosing time twice. This style of
progress is fatal to observation; moreover, none but a
special caravan, consisting of slaves hired for the purpose
in the island of Zanzibar or on the coast, and
accompanied by their own Ahbab or patron&mdash;without
whom they will obey no employer, however generous
or energetic&mdash;will enable the explorer to strike into an
unbeaten path, or to progress a few miles beyond the
terminus of a main trunk-road. The most enterprising
of porters will desert, leaving the caravan-leader like
a water-logged ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-344">[344]</span></p>

<p>Between these two extremes are the trading parties
directed by the Wasawahili, the Wamrima, and the slave
Fundi&mdash;the Pombeiros of West Africa&mdash;kindred souls
with the Pagazi, understanding their languages and
familiar with their habits, manners, and customs.
These “Safari” are neither starved like those composed
of Wanyamwezi, nor pampered like those headed by
the Arabs. There is less fatigue during the march,
and more comfort at the halting-place, consequently
there are fewer cases of disease and death. These semi-African
Mtongi, hating and jealousing Arabs and all
strangers, throw every obstacle in their way, spread
reports concerning their magical and malevolent powers
which are dangerous amongst the more superstitious
barbarians, they offer a premium for desertion, and in
fine, they labour hard though fruitlessly, to retain their
ancient monopoly of the profits derived from the interior.</p>

<p>I will now describe the day’s march and the halt of
the East African caravan.</p>

<p>At 3 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>, all is silent as the tomb, even the Mnyamwezi
watchman nods over his fire. About an hour
later the red-faced apoplectic chanticleer&mdash;there are
sometimes half-a-dozen of them&mdash;the alarum of the
caravan, and a prime favourite with the slaves and
porter, who carry him on their banghy-poles by turns,
and who drench him with water when his beak opens
under the sun,&mdash;flaps his wings and crows a loud
salutation to the dawn: he is answered by every cock and
cockerel within ear-shot. I have been lying awake for
some time, longing for the light, and when in health,
for an early breakfast. At the first paling of the East,
the torpid Goanese are called up to build a fire, they
tremble with the cold&mdash;thermometrically averaging
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-345">[345]</span>
60° F.&mdash;and they hurry to bring food. Appetite somewhat
difficult at this hour, demands a frequent change
of diet, we drink tea or coffee when procurable, or we eat
rice-milk and cakes raised with whey, or a porridge not
unlike water-gruel. Whilst we are so engaged, the
Baloch chanting the spiritual songs which follow
prayers, squat round a cauldron placed upon a roaring
fire, and fortify the inner man with boiled meat and
grain, with toasted pulse and tobacco.</p>

<p>About such time, 5 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>, the camp is fairly roused,
and a little low chatting becomes audible. This is a
critical moment. The porters have promised overnight,
to start early, and to make a long wholesome march.
But, “uncertain, coy, and hard to please,” they change
their minds like the fair sex, the cold morning makes
them unlike the men of the warm evening, and perhaps
one of them has fever. Moreover, in every caravan
there is some lazy, loud-lunged, contradictory and unmanageable
fellow, whose sole delight is to give trouble.
If no march be in prospect, they sit obstinately before
the fire warming their hands and feet, inhaling the
smoke with everted heads, and casting quizzical looks
at their fuming and fidgety employer. If all be unanimous,
it is vain to attempt them, even soft sawder is
but “throwing comfits to cows.” We return to our
tent. If, however, there be a division, a little active
stimulating will cause a march. Then a louder conversation
leads to cries of Kwecha! Kwecha! Pakia!
Pakia! Hopa! Hopa! Collect! pack! set out! Safari!
Safari leo! a journey, a journey to-day! and some
peculiarly African boasts, P’hunda! Ngami! I am an
ass! a camel! accompanied by a roar of bawling voices,
drumming, whistling, piping, and the braying of Barghumi,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-346">[346]</span>
or horns. The sons of Ramji come in a body
to throw our tents, and to receive small burdens, which,
if possible, they shirk; sometimes Kidogo does me the
honour to inquire the programme of the day. The
porters, however, hug the fire till driven from it, when
they unstack the loads piled before our tents and pour
out of the camp or village. My companion and I,
when well enough to ride, mount our asses, led by the
gunbearers, who carry all necessaries for offence and defence;
when unfit for exercise, we are borne in hammocks,
slung to long poles, and carried by two men at a time.
The Baloch tending their slaves hasten off in a straggling
body, thinking only of escaping an hour’s sun.
The Jemadar, however, is ordered to bring up the rear
with Said bin Salim, who is cold and surly, abusive
and ready with his rattan. Four or five packs have
been left upon the ground by deserters, or shirkers, who
have started empty-handed, consequently our Arab
either double-loads more willing men, or persuades the
sons of Ramji to carry a small parcel each, or that
failing, he hires from some near village a few porters
by the day. This, however, is not easy, the beads have
been carried off, and the most tempting promises without
pre-payment, have no effect upon the African mind.</p>

<p>When all is ready, the Kirangozi or Mnyamwezi
guide rises and shoulders his load, which is ever one of
the lightest. He deliberately raises his furled flag, a
plain blood-red, the sign of a caravan from Zanzibar,
much tattered by the thorns, and he is followed by a
privileged Pagazi, tom-toming upon a kettle-drum
much resembling a European hour-glass. The dignitary
is robed in the splendour of scarlet broadcloth, a
narrow piece about six feet long, with a central aperture
for the neck, and with streamers dangling before and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-347">[347]</span>
behind; he also wears some wonderful head-dress, the
spoils of a white and black “tippet-monkey,” or the
barred skin of a wild cat, crowning the head, bound
round the throat, hanging over the shoulders, and
capped with a tall cup-shaped bunch of owl’s feathers,
or the gorgeous plumes of the crested crane. His insignia
of office are the kipungo or fly-flapper, the tail of some
beast which he affixes to his person as if it were a
natural growth, the kome, or hooked iron spit, decorated
with a central sausage of parti-coloured beads, and
a variety of oily little gourds containing snuff, simples,
and “medicine,” for the road, strapped round his waist.
He leads the caravan, and the better to secure the obedience
of his followers he has paid them in a sheep or a
goat, the value of which he will recover by fees and superiority
of rations&mdash;the head of every animal slaughtered
in camp and the presents at the end of the journey are
exclusively his. A man guilty of preceding the Kirangozi
is liable to fine, and an arrow is extracted from his
quiver to substantiate his identity at the end of the
march. Pouring out of the kraal in a disorderly mob,
the porters stack their goods at some tree distant but a
few hundred yards, and allow the late, the lazy, and the
invalids to join the main body. Generally at this conjuncture
the huts are fired by neglect or mischievousness.
The khambi, especially in winter, burns like tinder, and
the next caravan will find a heap of hot ashes and a
few charred sticks still standing. Yet by way of contrast
the Pagazi will often take the trouble to denote
by the usual signposts to those following them that
water is at hand. Here and there a little facetiousness
appears in these erections, a mouth is cut in the tree-trunk
to admit a bit of wood, simulating a pipe, with
other representations still more waggish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-348">[348]</span></p>

<p>After the preliminary halt, the caravan, forming into
the order of march, winds, like a monstrous land-serpent,
over hill, dale, and plain. The Kirangozi is followed
by an Indian file, those nearest to him, the grandees
of the gang, are heavily laden with ivories: when the
weight of the tusk is inordinate, it is tied to a pole and
is carried palanquin-fashion by two men. A large cowbell,
whose music rarely ceases on the march, is attached
to the point which is to the fore; to the bamboo behind
is lashed the porter’s private baggage,&mdash;his earthen
cooking-pot, his water-gourd, his sleeping-mat, and his
other necessaries. The ivory-carriers are succeeded by
the bearers of cloth and beads, each man, poising upon
either shoulder, and sometimes raising upon the head
for rest, packs that resemble huge bolsters, six feet long
by two in diameter, cradled in sticks, which generally
have a forked projection for facility of stacking and
reshouldering the load. The sturdiest fellows are
usually the lightest loaded: in Eastern Africa, as elsewhere,
the weakest go to the wall. The maximum of
burden may be two farasilah, or seventy pounds, avoirdupois.
Behind the cloth bearers straggles a long line
of porters and slaves, laden with the lighter stuff,
rhinoceros-teeth, hides, salt-cones, tobacco, brass wire,
iron hoes, boxes and bags, beds and tents, pots and
water-gourds, mats and private stores. With the Pagazi,
but in separate parties, march the armed slaves,
who are never seen to quit their muskets, the women,
and the little toddling children, who rarely fail to carry
something, be it only of a pound weight, and the asses
neatly laden with saddle-bags of giraffe or buffalo-hide.
A “Mganga” almost universally accompanies the caravan,
not disdaining to act as a common porter. The
“parson” not only claims, in virtue of his sacred calling,
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-349">[349]</span>
the lightest load; he is also a stout, smooth, and sleek-headed
man, because, as usual with his class, he eats much
and he works little. The rear is brought up by the
master or the masters of the caravan, who often remains
far behind for the convenience of walking and to
prevent desertion.</p>

<p>All the caravan is habited in its worst attire, the
East African derides those who wear upon a journey
the cloth which should be reserved for display at
home. If rain fall they will doff the single goat-skin
hung round their sooty limbs, and, folding it up,
place it between the shoulder and the load. When
grain is served out for some days’ march, each porter
bears his posho or rations fastened like a large “bussel”
to the small of his back. Upon this again, he
sometimes binds, with its legs projecting outwards,
the three-legged stool, which he deems necessary to
preserve him from the danger of sitting upon the
damp ground. As may be imagined, the barbarians
have more ornament than dress. Some wear the
ngala, a strip of zebra’s mane bound round the head
with the bristly parti-coloured, hair standing out like a
saint’s “gloria:” others prefer a long bit of stiffened
ox-tail, rising like a unicorn’s horn, at least a foot
above the forehead. Other ornaments are the skins of
monkeys and ocelots, rouleaus and fillets of white, blue,
or scarlet cloth, and huge bunches of ostrich, crane,
and jay’s feathers, crowning the head like the tufts of
certain fowls. Their arms are decorated with massive
ivory bracelets, heavy bangles of brass or copper, and
thin circlets of the same metal, beads in strings and
bands, adorn their necks, and small iron bells, a
“knobby” decoration, whose incessant tinkling harmonises,
in African ears, with the regular chime-like “Ti-ti!
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-350">[350]</span>
Ti-ti! tang!” of the tusk-bells, and the loud broken
“Wa-ta-ta!” of the horns, are strapped below the knee
or round the ankle by the more aristocratic. All carry
some weapon; the heaviest armed have a bow and a
bark-quiver full of arrows, two or three long spears
and assegais, a little battle-axe borne on the shoulder,
and the sime or dudgeon.</p>

<p>The normal recreations of a march are, whistling,
singing, shouting, hooting, horning, drumming, imitating
the cries of birds and beasts, repeating words which
are never used except on journeys&mdash;a “chough’s language,
gabble enough and good enough”&mdash;and abundant
squabbling; in fact perpetual noise which the ear
however, soon learns to distinguish for the hubbub of a
halt. The uproar redoubles near a village, where the
flag is unfurled and where the line lags to display
itself. All give vent to loud shouts, “Hopa! hopa!&mdash;go
on! go on! Mgogolo!&mdash;a stoppage! Food! food!
Don’t be tired! The kraal is here&mdash;home is near!
Hasten, kirangozi&mdash;Oh! We see our mothers! We go
to eat!” On the road it is considered prudent as well as
pleasurable to be as loud as possible, in order to impress
upon plunderers an exaggerated idea of the caravan’s
strength; for equally good reasons silence is recommended
in the kraal. When threatened with attack
and no ready escape suggests itself, the porters ground
their loads and prepare for action. It is only self-interest
that makes them brave; I have seen a small cow,
trotting up with tail erect, break a line of 150 men
carrying goods not their own. If a hapless hare or
antelope cross the path, every man casts his pack,
brandishes his spear, and starts in pursuit; the animal
never running straight is soon killed, and torn limb
from limb, each negroid helluo devouring his morsel
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-351">[351]</span>
raw. Sometimes a sturdy fellow “renowns it” by
carrying his huge burden round and round, like a horse
being ringed, and starts off at full speed. When two bodies
meet, that commanded by an Arab claims the road. If
both are Wanyamwezi, violent quarrels ensue, but fatal
weapons, which are too ready at hand, are turned to
more harmless purposes, the bow and spear being used
as whip and cudgel. These affrays are not rancorous
till blood is shed. Few tribesmen are less friendly for so
trifling an affair as a broken head; even a slight cut or
a shallow stab is little thought of; but, if returned with
interest, great loss of life may arise from the slenderest
cause. When friendly caravans meet, the two Kirangozis
sidle up with a stage pace, a stride, and a stand,
and with sidelong looks prance till arrived within distance;
then suddenly and simultaneously “ducking,”
like boys “giving a back,” they come to logger-heads
and exchange a butt violently as fighting rams. Their
example is followed by all with a rush and a crush,
which might be mistaken for the beginning of a faction,
but it ends, if there be no bad blood, in shouts of
laughter. The weaker body, however, must yield precedence
and offer a small present as blackmail.</p>

<p>About 8 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>, when the fiery sun has topped the trees
and a pool of water, or a shady place appears, the
planting of the red flag, the braying of a Barghumi, or
koodoo’s horn, which, heard at a distance in the deep
forests, has something of the charm which endears the
“Cor de Chasse” to every woodman’s ear, and sometimes
a musket-shot or two, announces a short halt. The
porters stack their loads, and lie or loiter about for a
few minutes, chatting, drinking, and smoking tobacco
and bhang, with the usual whooping, screaming cough,
and disputing eagerly about the resting-place for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-352">[352]</span>
day. On long marches we then take the opportunity
of stopping to discuss the contents of two baskets which
are carried by a slave under the eye of the Goanese.</p>

<p>If the stage be prolonged towards noon, the caravan
lags, straggles, and suffers sorely. The heat of the
ground, against which the horniest sole never becomes
proof, tries the feet like polished-leather boots on
a quarter-deck in the dog-days near the Line, and
some tribulation is caused by the cry M’iba hapa!&mdash;thorns
here! The Arabs and the Baloch must often halt
to rest. The slaves ensconce themselves in snug places;
the porters, propping their burdens against trees, curl
up, dog-like, under the shade; some malinger; and this,
the opportunity preferred for desertion, is an anxious
hour to the proprietor; who, if he would do his work
“deedily,” must be the last in the kraal. Still the men
rarely break down. As in Indian marching, the African
caravan prefers to end the day, rather than to begin it,
with a difficulty&mdash;the ascent of a hill, or the fording of
a stream. They prefer the strip of jungle at the further
end of a district or a plantation, for safety as well as
for the comfort of shade. They avoid the vicinity of
rocks; and on desert plains they occupy some slightly
rising ground, where the night-cold is less severe than
in the lower levels.</p>

<p>At length an increased hubbub of voices, blended
with bells, drums, fifes, and horns, and sometimes a few
musket-shots, announce that the van is lodged, and the
hubbub of the halt confirms the pleasing intelligence
that the journey is shortened by a stage. Each selfish
body then hurries forward to secure the best boothy
in the kraal, or the most comfortable hut in the
village, and quarrels seem serious. Again, however,
the knife returns home guiltless of gore, and the
spear is used only as an instrument for sound belabouring.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-353">[353]</span>
The more energetic at once apply themselves
to “making all snug” for the long hot afternoon and the
nipping night; some hew down young trees, others
collect heaps of leafy boughs; one acts architect, and
many bring in huge loads of firewood. The East African
is so much accustomed to house-life, that the bivouac in
the open appears to him a hardship; he prefers even
to cut out the interior of a bush and to squat in it, the
portrait of a comfortable cynocephalus. We usually
spread our donkey-saddles and carpets in some shade,
awaiting the arrival of our tents, and its erection by the
grumbling sons of Ramji; if we want a hut, we draw
out the man in possession like a badger,&mdash;he will never
have the decency to offer it. As a rule, the villagers are
more willing to receive the upward-bound caravans, than
those who, returning, carry wealth out of instead of into
the country. Merchants, on account of their valuable
outfits, affect, except in the safest localities, the khambi
rather than the village; the latter, however, is not only
healthier, despite its uncleanliness in miasmatic lands,
but is also more comfortable, plenty and variety of provisions
being more readily procured inside than outside.
The Arab’s khaymah is a thin pole or ridge-tent of
flimsy domestics, admitting sun and rain, and, like an
Irish cabin, permitting at night the occupant to tell
time by the stars; yet he prefers it, probably for
dignity, to the boothy which, in this land of verdure
and cool winds, is a far more comfortable lodging.</p>

<p>The Wamrima willingly admit strangers into their
villages; the Wazaramo would do the same, but they
are constantly at feud with the Wanyamwezi, who
therefore care not to avail themselves of the dangerous
hospitality. In K’hutu caravans seize by force the best
lodgings. Throughout Eastern Usagara travellers pitch
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-354">[354]</span>
tents in the dear central spaces, surrounded by the round
huts of the peasantry, under whose low and drooping
eaves the pagazi find shelter. In the western regions,
where the Tembe or square village prevails, kraals form
the nighting-place. In Ugogo strangers rarely enter the
hamlets, the hovels being foul, and the people dangerous.
Throughout Eastern and Central Unyamwezi caravans
defile into the villages without hesitation. Some parties
take possession of the Iwanza or public-house; others
build for themselves tabernacles of leafy boughs, which
they are expected to clear away before departure, and
the headman provides lodgings for the Mtongi. In
Western Unyamwezi the doors are often closed against
strangers, and in Eastern Uvinza the people will admit
travellers to bivouac, but they will not vacate their
huts. In Western Uvinza, a desert like Marenga and
Mgunda Mk’hali, substantial khambi occur at short
intervals. At Ujiji, the Sultan, after offering the preliminary
magubiko or presents, provides his guests with
lodgings, which, after a time sufficient for enabling
them to build huts, they must vacate in favour of
new comers. In the other Lake Regions the reception
depends mainly upon the number of muskets in a
caravan, and the character of the headman and his
people.</p>

<p>The khambi or kraal everywhere varies in shape and
material. In the eastern regions, where trees are scarce,
wattle frames of rough sticks, compacted with bark-fibre,
are disposed in a circle; the forked uprights, made
higher behind and lower in front, to form a sloping
roof, support horizontal or cross poles, which are overlaid
with a rough thatch of grass or grain-cane. The
central space upon which the boothies open is occupied
by one or more huts for the chiefs of the party; and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-355">[355]</span>
the outer circle is a loose fence of thorn branches, flimsy,
yet impassable to breech-less legs, unshod feet, and
thin loose body-garments. When a kraal must be built,
rations are not served out till enclosures made round
the camp secure the cattle; if the leader be dilatory, or
unwilling to take strong measures, he may be a serious
loser. The stationary kraals become offensive, if not
burnt down after a few months. The Masika-kraal, as
it is called, is that occupied only during the rainy
monsoon, when water is everywhere found. The vicinity
and the abundance of that necessary are the main
considerations in selecting the situation of encampments.
The bark-kraals commence in Uvinza, where
trees abound, and extend to the Tanganyika Lake; some
are substantial, as the temporary villages, and may be
a quarter of a mile in circumference. The Lakist
population carry with them, when travelling, Karagwah
or stiff mats of reed and rush; these they spread over
and fasten to a firmly-planted framework of flexible
boughs, not unlike a bird’s nest inverted, or they
build a cone of strong canes, in the shape of piled
muskets, with the ends lashed together. It is curious
to see the small compass in which the native African
traveller can contract himself: two, and even three, will
dispose their heads and part of their bodies&mdash;leaving
their lower limbs to the mercy of the elements&mdash;under
a matting little more than a yard square.</p>

<p>When lodgings in the kraal have been distributed,
and the animals have been off-packed, and water has
been brought from the pit or stream, all apply themselves
to the pleasant toil of refection. Merrily then
sounds the breathless chant of the woman pounding or
rubbing down grain, the song of the cook, and the tinkle-tinkle
of the slave’s pestle, as he bends over the iron
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-356">[356]</span>
mortar from which he stealthily abstracts the coffee.
The fireplaces are three stones or clods, placed trivet-wise
upon the ground, so that a draught may feed the
flame, they are far superior to the holes and trenches
of our camps and pic-nics. The tripod supports a small
black earthen pot, round which the khambi or little
knot of messmates perseveringly squat despite the
stinging sun. At home where they eat their own provisions
they content themselves with a slender meal of
flour and water once a day. But like Spaniards, Arabs,
and all abstemious races, they must “make up for lost
time.” When provisions are supplied to them, they
are cooking and consuming as long as the material
remains; the pot is in perpetual requisition, now filled
to be emptied, then refilled to be re-emptied. They will
devour in three days the rations provided for eight,
and then complain loudly that they are starved. To
leave a favourable impression upon their brains, I had a
measure nearly double that generally used, yet the perverse
wretches pleading hunger, though they looked
like aldermen by the side of the lean bony anatomies
whom they met on the road, would desert whenever
met by a caravan. After a time there will, doubtless,
be a re-action; when their beards whiten they will
indulge in the garrulity of age; they will recount to
wondering youth the prodigality of the Muzungu, in
filling them with grain, even during the longest marches,
and they will compare his loads of cloth and beads with
the half dozen “shaggy” cows and the worn-out hoes,
the sole outfit for presents and provisions carried by
caravans of “Young Africa.” If there be any delay in
serving out provisions, loud cries of Posho! p’hamba!&mdash;rations!
food!&mdash;resound through the camp; yet
when fatigued, the porters will waste hours in apathetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-357">[357]</span>
idleness rather than walk a few hundred yards to buy
grain. Between their dozen meals they puff clouds of
pungent tobacco, cough and scream over their jungle-bhang,
and chew ashes, quids, and pinches of red earth,
probably the graves of white ants. If meat be served
out to them, it is eaten as a relish; it never, however,
interferes with the consumption of porridge. A sudden
glut of food appears to have the effect of intoxicating
them. The Arabs, however, avoiding steady rations,
alternately gorge and starve their porters, knowing by
experience that such extremes are ever most grateful to
the barbarian stomach. The day must be spent in very
idleness; a man will complain bitterly if told to bring
up his pack for opening; and general discontent, with
hints concerning desertion, will arise from the mortification
of a muster. On such occasions he and his fellows
will raise their voices,&mdash;when not half-choked by food&mdash;and
declare that they will not be called about like servants,
and crouch obstinately round the smoky fire, the
pictures of unutterable disgust; and presently enjoy
the sweet savour of stick-jaw dough and pearl-holcus
like small shot, rat stews, and boiled weeds, which they
devour till their “bulge” appears like the crop of a
stuffed turkey. Sometimes when their improvidence
has threatened them with a Banyan-day, they sit in a
melancholy plight, spitefully smoking and wickedly eyeing
our cooking-pots; on these occasions they have
generally a goat or a bullock in store, and, if not, they
finesse to obtain one of ours. I always avoid issuing
an order to them direct, having been warned by experience
that Kidogo or the Kirangozi is the proper channel;
which sorely vexes Valentine and Seedy Bombay, whose
sole enjoyment in life is command. I observed that
when wanted for extra-work, to remove thorns or
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-358">[358]</span>
to dig for water, that the false alarm of Posho! (rations)
summons them with a wonderful alacrity.
Moreover, I remarked that when approaching their country
and leaving ours&mdash;the coast&mdash;they became almost
unmanageable and <i>vice versâ</i> as conditions changed.</p>

<p>My companion and I pass our day as we best can,
sometimes in a bower of leafy branches, often under
a spreading tree, rarely in the flimsy tent. The usual
occupations are the diary and the sketch-book, added to
a little business. The cloth must be doled out, and the
porters must be persuaded, when rested, to search the
country for rations, otherwise&mdash;the morrow will be a
blank. When a bullock is killed one of us must be present.
The porters receive about a quarter of the meat, over
which they sit wrangling and screaming like hyænas,
till a fair division according to messes is arrived at.
Then, unless watched, some strong and daring hand will
suddenly break through the ring, snatch up half a dozen
portions and disappear at a speed defying pursuit;
others will follow his example, with the clatter and
gesture of a troop of baboons, and the remainder will
retire as might be expected, grumbling and discontented.
Dinner at 4 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> breaks the neck of the day.
Provisions of some kind are mostly procurable, our diet,
however, varies from such common doings as the hard
holcus-scone, the tasteless bean-broth and the leathery
goat-steak, to fixings of delicate venison, fatted capon,
and young guinea-fowl or partridge, with “bread
sauce,” composed of bruised rice and milk. At first
the Goanese declined to cook “pretty food,” as pasties
and rissoles, on the plea that such things were impossible
upon the march; they changed their minds when
warned that persistence in such theory might lead to a
ceremonious fustigation. Moreover, they used to serve
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-359">[359]</span>
us after their fashion, with a kind of “portion” on
plates; the best part, of course, remained in the pots
and digesters; these, therefore, were ordered to do duty
as dishes. When tea or coffee is required in a drinkable
state, we must superintend the process of preparing it,
the notions of the Goanese upon such subjects being
abominable to the civilised palate. When we have
eaten our servants take their turn; they squat opposite
each other over a private “cooking-pot” to which they
have paid unremitting attention; they stretch forth their
talons and eat till weary, not satiated, pecking, nodding,
and cramming like two lank black pigeons. Being
“Christians,” that is to say, Roman Catholics, they
will not feed with the heathenry, moreover a sort of
semi-European dignity forbids. Consequently Bombay
messes with his “brother” Mabruki, and the other
slaves eat by themselves.</p>

<p>When the wells ahead are dry the porters will scarcely
march in the morning; their nervous impatience of thirst
is such that they would exhaust all their gourds, if they
expected a scarcity in front, and then they would suffer
severely through the long hot day. They persist, moreover,
upon eating before the march, under the false
impression that it gives them strength and bottom. In
fact, whenever difficulties as regards grain or drink
suggest themselves, the African requires the direction
of some head-piece made of better stuff than his own.
The hardships of the tirikeza have already been described:
they must be endured to be realised.</p>

<p>Night is ushered in by penning and pounding the
cows, and by tethering the asses&mdash;these “careless
Æthiopians” lose them every second day,&mdash;and by collecting
and numbering the loads, a task of difficulty
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-360">[360]</span>
where every man shirks the least trouble. When there
has been no tirikeza, when provisions have been
plentiful, and when there is a bright moonshine, which
seems to enliven these people like jackals, a furious
drumming, a loud clapping of hands, and a general
droning song, summon the lads and the lasses of the
neighbouring villages to come out and dance and “make
love.” The performance is laborious, but these Africans,
like most men of little game, soon become too tired to work,
but not too tired to play and amuse themselves. Their
style of salutation is remarkable only for the excessive
gravity which it induces; at no other time does the
East African look so serious, so full of earnest purpose.
Sometimes a single dancer, the village buffoon, foots
a <i>pas seul</i>, featly, with head, arms, and legs, bearing
strips of hair-garnished cow-skin, which are waved,
jerked, and contorted, as if dislocation had occurred to
his members. At other times, a line or a circle of boys
and men is formed near the fire, and one standing in
the centre, intones the song solo, the rest humming a
chorus in an undertone. The dancers plumbing and
tramping to the measure with alternate feet, simultaneously
perform a treadmill exercise with a heavier
stamp at the end of every period: they are such timists,
that a hundred pair of heels sound like one. At first
the bodies are slowly swayed from side to side, presently
as excitement increases, the exercise waxes severe:
they “cower down and lay out their buttocks,” to use
pedantic Ascham’s words, “as though they would shoot
at crows;” they bend and recover themselves, and they
stoop and rise to the redoubled sound of the song and
the heel-music, till the assembly, with arms waving
like windmills, assumes the frantic semblance of a
ring of Egyptian Darwayshes. The performance often
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-361">[361]</span>
closes with a grand promenade; all the dancers being
jammed in a rushing mass, a <i>galop infernale</i>, with the
features of satyrs, and gestures resembling aught but
the human. When the fun threatens to become too
fast and furious, the song dies, and the performers, with
loud shouts of laughter, throw themselves on the
ground, to recover strength and breath. The greybeards
look on with admiration and sentiment, remembering
the days when they were capable of similar feats.
Instead of “bravo,” they ejaculate “Nice! nice! very
nice!” and they wonder what makes the white men
laugh. The ladies prefer to perform by themselves,
and perhaps in the East, ours would do the same, if a
literal translation of the remarks to which a ball always
gives rise amongst Orientals, happened by misfortune to
reach their refined ears.</p>

<p>When there is no dancing, and the porters can no
longer eat, drink, and smoke, they sit by their fires,
chatting, squabbling, talking and singing some such
“pure nectar” as the following. The song was composed,
I believe, in honour of me, and I frequently heard
it when the singers knew that it was understood. The
Cosmopolitan reader will not be startled by the epithet
“Mbaya,” or wicked, therein applied to the Muzungu.
A “good white man,” would indeed, in these lands, have
been held an easy-going soul, a natural, an innocent,
like the “buona famiglia,” of the Italian cook, who ever
holds the highest quality of human nature to be a
certain facility for being “plucked without ’plaining,”
and being “flayed without flinching.” Moreover,
despite my “wickedness,” they used invariably to come
to me for justice and redress, especially when proximity
to the coast encouraged the guide and guards to “bully”
them.</p>

<p>The Baloch and the sons of Ramji quarrel, yell,
roar, and talk of eating&mdash;the popular subject of converse
in these lands, as is beer in England, politics in
France, law in Normandy, “pasta” at Naples, and to
say no more, money everywhere&mdash;till a late hour.
About 8 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, the small hours of the country, sounds
the cry lala! lala!&mdash;sleep! It is willingly obeyed by
all except the women, who must sometimes awake to
confabulate even at midnight. One by one the caravan
sinks into torpid slumber. At this time, especially
when in the jungle-bivouac, the scene often becomes
truly impressive. The dull red fires flickering and
forming a circle of ruddy light in the depths of the
black forest, flaming against the tall trunks and defining
the foliage of the nearer trees, illuminate lurid groups
of savage men, in every variety of shape and posture.
Above, the dark purple sky, studded with golden points,
domes the earth with bounds narrowed by the gloom
of night. And, behold! in the western horizon, a resplendent
crescent, with a dim, ash-coloured globe in
its arms, and crowned by Hesperus, sparkling like
a diamond, sinks through the vast of space, in all the
glory and gorgeousness of Eternal Nature’s sublimest
works. From such a night, methinks, the Byzantine
man took his device, the Crescent and the Star.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-363">[363]</span></p>

<p>The rate of caravan-marching in East Africa greatly
varies. In cool moonlit mornings, over an open path, the
Pagazi will measure perhaps four miles an hour. This
speed is reduced by a quarter after a short “spurt,” and
under normal, perhaps favourable, circumstances, three
statute miles will be the highest average. Throughout
the journey it is safe to reckon for an Indian file
of moderate length&mdash;say 150 men&mdash;2·25 English miles,
or what is much the same, 1·75 geographical miles per
hour, measured by compass from point to point. In a
clear country an allowance of 20 per cent, must be
made for winding: in closer regions 40-50 per cent.,
and the traveller must exercise his judgment in distributing
his various courses between these extremes. Mr.
Cooley (Inner Africa Laid Open, p. 6) a “resolute,” and
I may add a most successful “reducer of itinerary distances,”
estimates that the ordinary day’s journey of the
Portuguese missionaries in West Africa never exceeded
six geographical miles projected in a straight line, and
that on rare occasions, and with effort only, it may
have extended to 10 miles. Dr. Lacerda’s porters in
East Africa were terrified at the thought of marching
ordinarily 2·50 Portuguese leagues, or about 9·33 statute
miles per day. Dr. Livingstone gives the exceedingly
high maximum of 2·50 to 3 miles an hour in a straight
line, but his porters were lightly laden, and the
Makololo are apparently a far “gamer” race, more
sober and industrious, than the East Africans. Mr.
Petherick, H. M.’s Consul at Khartum, estimates his
gangs to have marched 3·50 miles per hour, and
the ordinary day’s march at 8 hours. It is undoubted
that the negro races north of the equator far
surpass in pedestrian powers their southern brethren;
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-364">[364]</span>
moreover the porters in question were marching only
for a single day; but as no instruments were used, the
average may fairly be suspected of exaggeration. Finally
Mr. Galton’s observation concerning Cape travelling
applies equally well to this part of Africa, namely, that
10 statute or 6 rectilinear geographical miles per diem
is a fair average of progress, and that he does well who
conducts the same caravan 1,000 geographical miles
across a wild country in six months.</p>

<p>I will conclude this chapter with a succinct account
of the inn, that is to say the village in East Africa.</p>

<p>The habitations of races form a curious study and no
valueless guide to the nature of the climate and the
physical conditions to which men are subject.</p>

<p>Upon the East African coast the villages, as has been
mentioned, are composed of large tenements, oblongs or
squares of wattle and dab, with eaves projecting to form
a deep verandah and a thatched pent-roof, approaching
in magnitude that of Madagascar.</p>

<p>Beyond the line of maritime land the “Nyumba” or
dwelling-house assumes the normal African form, the
circular hut described by every traveller in the interior:
Dr. Livingstone appears to judge rightly that its circularity
is the result of a barbarous deficiency in inventiveness.
It has, however, several varieties. The
simplest is a loose thatch thrown upon a cone of sticks
based upon the ground, and lashed together at the
apex: it ignores windows, and the door is a low hole
in the side. A superior kind is made after the manner
of our ancient bee hives; it is cup-shaped with bulging
sides, and covered with neat thatch, cut in circles
which overlap one another tile-fashion: at a distance
it resembles an inverted bird’s nest. The common
shape is a cylindrical framework of tall staves, or the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-365">[365]</span>
rough trunks of young trees planted in the earth,
neatly interwoven with parallel and concentric rings
of flexible twigs and withies: this is plastered inside
and outside with a hard coat of red or grey mud;
in the poorer tenements the surface is rough and
chinked, in the better order it is carefully smoothed
and sometimes adorned with rude imitations of life.
The diameter averages from 20 to 25, and the height
from 7 to 15 feet in the centre, which is supported
by a strong roof-tree, to which all the stacked rafters
and poles converge. The roof is subsequently added,
it is a structure similar to the walls, interwoven
with sticks, upon which thick grass or palm-fronds are
thrown, and the whole is covered with thatch tied on
by strips of tree-bark. It has eaves which projecting from
two to six feet&mdash;under them the inhabitants love to sit
or sun shade themselves&mdash;rest upon horizontal bars, which
are here and there supported by forked uprights, trees
rudely barked. Near the coast the eaves are broad and
high: in the interior they are purposely made so low
that a man must creep in on all fours. The door-way
resembles the entrance to an English pig-sty, it serves,
however, to keep out heat in the hot season, and to
keep in smoke and warmth during the rains and the
cold weather: the threshold is garnished with a horizontal
log or board that defends the interior from inundation.
The door is a square of reeds fastened together
by bark or cord, and planted upright at night between
the wall and two dwarf posts at each side of the entrance:
there is generally a smaller and a secret door
opposite that in use, and jealously closed up except
when flight is necessary. In the colder and damper
regions there is a second wall and roof outside the first,
forming in fact one house within the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-366">[366]</span></p>

<p>About Central Usagara the normal African haystack-hut
makes place for the “Tembe” which extends westward,
a little beyond Unyanyembe. The Tembe, though
of Hamitic origin, resembles the Utum of the ancients,
and the Hishan of the modern Hejaz, those hollow
squares of building which have extended through Spain
to France and even to Ireland: it was, probably, suggested
to Africa and to Arabia by the necessity of
defence to, as well as lodging for, man and beast. It is
to a certain extent, a proof of civilisation in Eastern
Africa: the wildest tribes have not progressed beyond
the mushroom or circular hut, a style of architecture
which seems borrowed from the indigenous mimosa tree.</p>

<p>Westward of Unyamwezi in Uvinza and about the
Tanganyika Lake the round hovel again finds favour
with the people; but even there the Arabs prefer to
build for themselves the more solid and comfortable
Tembe.</p>

<p>The haystack-hut has been described by a multitude
of travellers: the “Tembe,” or hollow village, yet
awaits that honour.</p>

<p>The “Tembe” wants but the addition of white-wash
to make it an effective feature in African scenery: as it
is, it appears from afar like a short line of raised earth.
Provided with a block-house at each angle to sweep
dead ground where fire, the only mode of attack practised
in these regions, can be applied, it would become a
fort impregnable to the Eastern African. The form is
a hollow square or oblong, generally irregular, with
curves, projections, and semicircles; in the East
African Ghauts, the shape is sometimes round or oval
to suit the exigencies of the hill-sides and the dwarf
cones upon which it is built. On the mountains and in
Ugogo, where timber is scarce, the houses form the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-367">[367]</span>
continued frontage of the building, which, composed of
mimosa-trunks, stout stakes, and wattle and dab, rarely
exceeds seven feet in height. In the southern regions
of Usagara where the Tembe is poorest, the walls are of
clods loosely put together and roofed over with a little
straw. About Msene where fine trees abound, the Tembe
is surrounded by a separate boma or palisade of young
unbarked trunks, short or tall, and capped here and
there with cattle-skulls, blocks of wood, grass-wisps,
and similar talismans; this stockade, in damper places,
is hedged with a high thick fence, sometimes doubled
and trebled, of peagreen milk-bush, which looks pretty
and refreshing, and is ditched outside with a deep
trench serving as a drain. The cleared space in front
of the main passage through the hedges is often decorated
with a dozen poles, placed in a wide semicircle to
support human skulls, the mortal remains of ill-conducted
boors. In some villages the principal entrance
is approached by long, dark and narrow lanes of palisading.
When the settlement is built purely for defence,
it is called “Kaya,” and its headman “Muinyi Kaya,”
the word, however, is sometimes used for “Boma” or
“Mji,” a palisaded village in general. In some parts
of Unyamwezi there is a Bandani or exterior boothy,
where the men work at the forge, or sit in the shade,
and where the women husk, pound, and cook their grain.</p>

<p>The general roof of the Tembe is composed of mud
and clay heaped upon grass thickly strewed over a
framework of rafters supported by the long walls. It
has, usually, an obtuse slope to the front and another
to the rear, that rain may not lie; it is, however, flat
enough to support the bark-bins of grain, gourds, old
pots, firewood, water-melons, pumpkins, manioc, mushrooms,
and other articles placed there to ripen or dry
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-368">[368]</span>
in the sun. It has no projecting eaves, and it is ascended
from the inside by the primitive ladder, the
inclined trunk of a tree, with steps formed by the
stumps of lopped boughs, acting rings. The roof,
during the rains, is a small plot of bright green grass:
I often regretted not having brought with me a little
store of mustard and cress. In each external side of
the square, one or two door-ways are pierced; they
are large enough to admit a cow, and though public
they often pass through private domiciles. They are
jealously closed at sunset, after which hour not a villager
dares to stir from his home till morning. The outer
doors are sometimes solid planks, more often they are
three or four heavy beams suspended to a cross-bar
passing through their tops. When the way is to be
opened they are raised from below and are kept up by
being planted in a forked tree-trunk inside the palisade:
they are let down when the entrance is to be closed,
and are barred across with strong poles.</p>

<p>The tenements are divided from one another by party-walls
of the same material as the exterior. Each
house has, usually, two rooms, a “but” and a “ben,”
which vary in length from 20 to 50 feet, and in depth
from 12 to 15: they are partitioned by a screen of corn-canes
supported by stakes, with a small passage left
open for light. The “but,” used as parlour, kitchen, and
dormitory, opens upon the common central square; the
“ben” receives a glimmer from the doors and chinks,
which have not yet suggested the idea of windows: it
serves for a sleeping and a store room; it is a favourite
place with hens and pigeons that aspire to be mothers,
and the lambs and kids in early infancy are allowed to
pass the night there. The inner walls are smeared with
mud: lime is not procurable in Eastern Africa, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-369">[369]</span>
people have apparently no predilection for the Indian
“Gobar:” floor is of tamped earth, rough, uneven,
and unclean. The prism-shaped ceiling is composed of
rafters and thin poles gently rising from the long-walls
to the centre, where they are supported by strong horizontals,
which run the whole length of the house, and
these again rest upon a proportionate number of pillars,
solid forked uprights, planted in the floor. The ceiling
is polished to a shiny black with smoke, which winds its
way slowly through the door&mdash;smoke and grease are
the African’s coat and small clothes, they contribute so
much to his health and comfort that he is by no means
anxious to get rid of them&mdash;and sooty lines depend
from it like negro-stalactites.</p>

<p>The common enceinte formed by the houses is often
divided into various courts, intended for different
families, by the walls of the tenements, or by stout
screens, and connected by long wynds and dark alleys
of palisade-work. The largest and cleanest square
usually belongs to the headman. In these spaces cattle
are milked and penned; the ground is covered with a
thick coat of the animals’ earths, dust in the hot weather
and deep viscid mud during the rains: the impurity
must be an efficacious fomite of cutaneous and pectoral
disease. The villagers are fond of planting in the central
courts trees, under whose grateful shade the loom
is plied, the children play, the men smoke, and the
women work. Here, also, stands the little Mzimu, or
Fetiss-hut, to receive the oblations of the pious. Places
are partitioned off from the public ground, near the
houses, by horizontal trunks of trees, resting on forks,
forming pens to keep the calves from the cows at
night. In some villages huge bolsters of surplus grain,
neatly packed in bark and corded round, are raised on
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-370">[370]</span>
tall poles near the interior doors of the tenements.
Often, too, the insides of the settlements boast of pigeon-houses,
which in this country are made to resemble, in
miniature, those of the people. In Unyamwezi the
centre is sometimes occupied by the Iwanza, or village
“public-house,” which will be described in a future
chapter.</p>

<p>In some regions, as in Ugogo, these lodgings become
peculiarly offensive if not burnt after the first year.
The tramping of the owners upon the roof shakes mud
and soot from the ceiling, and the rains wash down
masses of earthwork heavy enough to do injury. The
interior is a menagerie of hens, pigeons, and rats, of
peculiar impudence. Scorpions and earwigs fall from
their nests in the warm or shady rafters. The former,
locally termed “Nge,” is a small yellow variety, and
though it stings spitefully the pain seldom lasts through
the day; as many as three have dropped upon my couch
in the course of the week. In Ugogo there is a green
scorpion from four to five inches long, which inflicts a
torturing wound. According to the Arabs the scorpion
in Eastern Africa dies after inflicting five consecutive
stings, and commits suicide if a bit of stick be applied to
the middle of its back. The earwig is common in all damp
places, and it haunts the huts on account of the shade.
The insect apparently casts its coat before the rainy
season, and the Africans ignore the superstition which
in most European countries has given origin to its
trivial name. A small xylophagus with a large black
head rains a yellow dust like pollen from the riddled
woodwork; house-crickets chirp from evening to dawn;
cockroaches are plentiful as in an Indian steamer; and
a solitary mason-wasp, the “Kumbharni,” or “potter’s
wife” of western India&mdash;a large hymenopter of several
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-371">[371]</span>
varieties, tender-green, or black and yellow, or dark
metallic blue&mdash;burrows holes in the wall, or raises
plastered nests, and buzzes about the inmates’ ears;
lizards, often tailless after the duello, tumble from the
ceilings; in the darker corners spiders of frightful
hideousness weave their solid webs; and the rest of the
population is represented by tenacious ticks of many
kinds, flies of sorts, bugs, fleas, mosquitoes, and small
ants, which are, perhaps, the worst plagues of all. The
Riciniæ in Eastern Africa are locally called Papazi,
which probably explains the “Pazi bug,” made by Dr.
Krapf a rival in venom to the Argas Persicus, or fatal
“bug of Miana.” In Eastern Africa these parasites are
found of many shapes, round and oval, flat and swollen;
after suction they vary in size from microscopic dimensions
to three-quarters of an inch; the bite cannot
poison, but the constant irritation caused by it may
induce fever and its consequences. A hut infested with
Papazi must be sprinkled with boiling water, and swept
clean for many weeks, before they will disappear. In
the Tembe there is no draught to disturb the smaller
occupants, consequently they are more numerous than
in the circular cottage. Moreover, the people, having
an aversion to sleeping in the open air, thus supply
their co-inhabitants with nightly rations, which account
for their fecundity.</p>

<p>The abodes, as might be expected, are poorly furnished.
In Unyamwezi, they contain invariably one or more
“Kitanda.” This cartel, or bedstead, is a rude contrivance.
Two parallel lines of peeled tree-branches, planted at
wide intervals, support in their forks horizontal poles:
upon these is spread crosswise a layer of thick sticks,
which forms the frame. The bedding consists of a
bull-hide or two, and perhaps a long, coarse, rush-mat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-372">[372]</span>
It is impossible for any one but an African to sleep
upon these Kitanda, on account of their shortness, the
hardness of the material, and the rapid slope which
supplies the want of pillows, and serves for another
purpose which will not be described. When removed,
a fractured pole will pour forth a small shower of the
foul cimex: this people of hard skins considers its
bite an agreeable titillation, and, what may somewhat
startle a European, esteems its odour a perfume.
Around the walls depend from pegs neatly-plaited
slings of fibrous cord, supporting gourds and “vilindo”&mdash;neat
cylinders, like small band-boxes, of tree bark,
made to contain cloth, butter, grain, or other provisions.
In the store-room, propped upon stones, and plastered
over with clay for preservation, are Lindo, huge corn-bins
of the same material; grain is ground upon a
coarse granite slab, raised at an angle of 25°, about
one foot above the floor, and embedded in a rim of
hard clay. The hearth is formed of three “Mafiga,”
or truncated cones of red or grey mud, sometimes two
feet high, and ten inches in diameter at the base: they
are disposed triangularly, with the apex to the wall,
and open to the front when the fire is made. The pot
rests upon the tripod. The broom, a wisp of grass, a
bunch of bamboo splints, or a split fibrous root, usually
sticks in the ceiling; its work is left to the ants. From
the rafters hang drums and kettle-drums, skins and
hides in every process, and hooked twigs dangling
from strings support the bows and arrows, the spears
and assegais. An arrow is always thrust into the inner
thatch for good luck: ivory is stored between the
rafters, hence its dark ruddy colour, which must be
removed by ablution with warm blood; and the ceiling
is a favourite place for small articles that require
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-373">[373]</span>
seasoning&mdash;bows, quivers, bird-bolts, knob-sticks, walking-canes,
reed-nozzles for bellows, and mi’iko or ladles,
two feet long, used to stir porridge. The large and heavy
water-pots, of black clay, which are filled every morning
and evening by the women at the well, lie during
the day empty or half empty about the room. The
principal article of luxury is the “Kiti,” or dwarf
stool, cut out of a solid block, measuring one foot in
height by six inches in diameter, with a concave surface
for convenience of sitting: it has usually three carved
legs or elbows; some, however, are provided with a
fourth, and with a base like the seat, to steady them.
They are invariably used by the Sultan and the
Mganga, who disdain to sit upon the ground: and the
Wamrima ornament them with plates of tin let into the
upper concaves. The woods generally used for the Kiti,
are the Mninga and the Mpingu. The former is a tall
and stately tree, which supplies wood of a dark mahogany
colour, exuding in life a red gum, like dragon’s
blood: the trunk is converted into bowls and platters,
the boughs into rafters, which are, however, weak
and subject to the xylophagus, whilst of the heart
are made spears, which, when old and well-greased,
resemble teak-wood. The Mpingu is the Sisam of India,
(Dalbergia Sissoo) here erroneously called by the Arabs
Abnus&mdash;ebony. The tree is found throughout Eastern
Africa. The wood is of fine quality, and dark at the
core: the people divide it into male and female; the
former is internally a dark brick-dust red, whilst the
latter verges upon black: they make from it spears
and axe-handles, which soon, however, when exposed
to the air, unless regularly greased, become brittle.
The massive mortar, for husking grain, called by the
people “Mchi,” is shaped exactly like those portrayed
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-374">[374]</span>
in the interior-scenes of ancient Egypt: it is hewn out
of the trunk of the close-grained Mkora tree. The
huge pestle, like a capstan-bar, is made of the
Mkorongo, a large tree with a fine-grained wood, which
is also preferred to others for rafters, as it best resists
the attacks of insects.</p>

<p>Such, gentle reader, is the Tembe of Central Africa.
Concerning village life, I shall have something to say
in a future page. The scene is more patent to the
stranger’s eye in these lands than in the semi-civilised
regions of Asia, where men rarely admit him into their
society.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="noindent">I was detained at Kazeh from the 8th November to
the 14th December, 1857, and the delay was one long
trial of patience.</p>

<p>It is customary for stranger-caravans proceeding towards
Ujiji to remain six weeks or two months at
Unyanyembe for repose and recovery from the labours
which they have, or are supposed to have, endured:
moreover, they are expected to enjoy the pleasures of
civilised society, and to accept the hospitality offered to
them by the resident Arabs. In Eastern Africa, I may
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-376">[376]</span>
again suggest, six weeks is as the three days’ visit in
England.</p>

<p>On the morning after our arrival at Kazeh, the gang
of Wanyamwezi porters that had accompanied us from
the coast withdrew their hire from our cloth-bales;
and not demanding, because they did not expect,
bakhshish, departed, without a sign of farewell, to
their homes in Western Unyamwezi. The Kirangozi
or guide received a small present of domestics: his
family being at Msene, distant five marches ahead, he
fixed, after long haggling, the term of fifteen days as
his leave of absence, after which he promised to join me
with a fresh gang for the journey to Ujiji.</p>

<p>The rest of the party apparently considered Unyanyembe,
not Ujiji, the end of the exploration; it proved
in effect a second point of departure, easier than Kaole
only because I had now gained some experience.</p>

<p>Two days after our arrival, the Baloch, headed by
their Jemadar, appeared in full toilette to demand a
“Hakk el Salamah,” or reward for safe-conduct. I informed
them that this would be given when they
had reached the end of the up-march. The pragmatical
Darwaysh declared that without bakhshish there
would be no advance; he withdrew his words, however,
when my companion was called in to witness their being
committed to paper&mdash;a proceeding always unpalatable
to the Oriental. The Baloch then subsided
into begging for salt and spices, and having received
more than they had probably ever possessed in their
lives, they privily complained of my parsimony to Said
bin Salim. They then sent for tobacco, a goat, gunpowder,
bullets&mdash;all which they obtained. Their
next manœuvre was to extract four cloths for tinning
their single copper pot and for repairing the matchdogs
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-377">[377]</span>
and stocks of two old matchlocks. They then sold a
keg of gunpowder committed to their charge. They
had experienced every kindness from Snay bin Amir,
from Sallum bin Hamid, in fact, from all the Arab merchants
of Kazeh. They lodged comfortably in Musa
Mzuri’s house, and their allowance, one Shukkah of
domestics per diem, enabled them to buy goats, sheep,
and fowls&mdash;luxuries unknown in their starving huts at
Zanzibar. Yet they did not fail, with their foul tongues,
ever ready, as the Persians say, for “spitting at Heaven,”
to charge their kind hosts with the worst crime that
the Arab knows&mdash;niggardness.</p>

<p>On the 8th November, I had arranged with Kidogo, as
well as with the Kirangozi, to resume the march at the
end of a fortnight. Ten days afterwards I again sent
for him to conclude the plans concerning the journey:
evidently something lay deep within his breast, but the
difficulty was to extract it. He began by requiring a
present for his excellent behaviour&mdash;he received, to his
astonishment, four cloths. He next demanded leave to
visit his Unyamwezi home for a week, and was unpleasantly
surprised when it was granted. He then “hit the
right nail on the head.” The sons of Ramji, declaring that
I had promised them a bullock on arrival at Kazeh,
had seized, hamstrung, and cut up a fine fat animal sent
to me by Sallum bin Hamid; yet Kidogo averred that
the alleged promise must be fulfilled to them. When I
refused, he bluntly informed me that I was quite equal
to the task of collecting porters for myself; I replied
that this was his work and not mine. He left the house
abruptly, swearing that he would not trouble himself
any longer, and, moreover, for the future that his men
should not carry the lightest load, nor assist us even in
threading beads. At last, on the 27th November, I sent
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-378">[378]</span>
for Kidogo, and told him that the march was positively
fixed for the next week. After sitting for a time
“<i>cupo concentrato</i>,” in profound silence, the angry
slave arose, delivered a volley of rattling words with
the most theatrical fierceness, and rushed from the room,
leaving the terrified Said bin Salim gazing upon vacancy
like an idiot. Accompanied by his followers, who were
shouting and laughing, he left the house, when&mdash;I afterwards
heard&mdash;they drew their sabres, and waving them
round their heads, they shouted, for the benefit of
Arabs, “Tume-shinda Wazungu”&mdash;“We have conquered
the Whites!” I held a consultation with my
hosts concerning the advisability of disarming the recreant
sons of Ramji. But Sallum bin Hamid, the “papa”
of the colony, took up the word, and, as usual with such
deliberative bodies, the council of war advised peace.
They informed me that in Unyamwezi slaves and muskets
are the stranger’s sole protection, and as they were
unanimous in persuading me to temporise, to “swallow
anger” till after return, I felt bound, after applying
for it, to be guided by their advice. At the consultation,
however, the real object which delayed the sons
of Ramji at Kazeh oozed out: their patroon, Mr.
Rush Ramji, had written to them that his and their
trading outfit was on its way from the coast; consequently,
they had determined to await, and to make us
await, its arrival before marching upon Ujiji.</p>

<p>On the 14th November, the Masika or wet season,
which had announced its approach by premonitory
showers and by a final burst of dry heat, set in over
the Land of the Moon with torrents of rain and “rain-stones,”
as hail is here called, and with storms of thunder
and lightning, which made it more resemble the first
breaking of an Indian than the desultory fall of a Zanzibar
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-379">[379]</span>
wet-monsoon. I was still under the impression
that we were encountering the Choti Barsat or Little
Rains of Bengal and Bombay; and curious to say, the
Arabs of Unyanyembe one and all declared, even after the
wet-monsoon had reached its height, that the Masika
in Unyamwezi is synchronous with that of the island
and the coast, namely, in early April.</p>

<p>The Rains in Eastern Africa are, like the summer in
England, the only healthy and enjoyable season: the
contrast between the freshness of the air and the verdure
of the scenery after the heat, dust, and desolation
that preceded the first showers, was truly luxurious.
Yet the Masika has many disadvantages for travellers.
The Wanyamwezi, who were sowing their fields, declined
to act porters, and several Arab merchants, who
could not afford the expenditure required to hire unwilling
men, were halted perforce in and near Unyanyembe.
The peasants would come in numbers; offer to
accompany the caravan; stand, stare, and laugh their
vacant laughs; lift and balance their packs; chaffer
about hire; promise to return next morning, and definitively
disappear. With the utmost exertion Snay
bin Amir could collect only ten men, and they were all
ready to desert. Moreover, the opening of the Masika is
ever unhealthy; strangers suffer severely from all sudden
changes of temperature; Unyamwezi speedily became</p>

<p class="noindent">Another cause of delay became imminent; my companion
was comparatively strong, but the others were
prostrated by sickness. Valentine first gave in; he was
nearly insensible for three days and nights, the usual
period of the Mukunguru or “Seasoning” of Unyamwezi&mdash;a
malignant bilious remittent&mdash;which left him
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-380">[380]</span>
weaker and thinner than he had ever been before. When
he recovered, Gaetano fell ill, and was soon in the happy
state of unconsciousness which distinguished all his
fevers. The bull-headed slave Mabruki also retired into
private life, and Bombay was laid up by a shaking ague,
whilst the Baloch and the sons of Ramji, who had
led a life so irregular that the Arabs had frequently
threatened them with punishment, also began to pay the
penalty of excess.</p>

<p>Snay bin Amir was our principal doctor. An adept
in the treatment, called by his countrymen “camel-physic,”
namely, cautery and similar counter-irritants,
he tried his art upon me when I followed the example
of the party. At length, when the Hummah, or hot fit,
refused to yield to its supposed specific, a coating of
powdered ginger, he insisted upon my seeing a Mganga,
or witch, celebrated for her cures throughout the country-side.
She came, a wrinkled old beldame, with a
greasy skin, black as soot, set off by a mass of tin-coloured
pigtails: her arms were adorned with copper
bangles like manacles, and the implement of her craft
was, as usual, a girdle of small gourds dyed red-black
with oil and use.</p>

<p>After demanding and receiving her fee in cloth, she
proceeded to search my mouth, and to inquire anxiously
concerning poison. The question showed the prevalence
of the practice in the country, and indeed the
people, to judge from their general use of “Mithridates,”
seem ever to expect it. She then drew from
a gourd a greenish powder, which was apparently bhang,
and having mixed it with water, she administered it
like snuff, causing a convulsion of sneezing, which she
hailed with shouts and various tokens of joy. Presently
she rubbed my head with powder of another kind, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-381">[381]</span>
promising to return the next day, she left me to rest,
declaring that sleep would cause a cure. The prediction,
however, was not fulfilled, nor was the promise.
Having become wealthy, she absconded to indulge
in unlimited pombe for a week. The usual consequences
of this “seasoning,” distressing weakness, hepatic
derangements, burning palms, and tingling soles,
aching eyes, and alternate thrills of heat and cold,
lasted, in my case, a whole month.</p>

<p>Our departure from Kazeh had now been repeatedly
deferred. The fortnight originally fixed for the halt
had soon passed in the vain search for porters. Sickness
then delayed the journey till the 1st December, and
Snay bin Amir still opined that want of carriage would
detain me till the 19th of that month; he would not
name the 18th, which was an unlucky day. When they
recovered from their ailments, the Jemadar and the
Baloch again began to be troublesome. All declared
that a whole year, the term for which they had been
sent by their Prince, had elapsed, and therefore that
they had now a right to return. The period was wholly
one of their own, based perhaps upon an answer which
they had received from Lieut.-Col. Hamerton touching
the probable duration of the Expedition, “a year or
so.” Even of that time it still wanted five months,
but nothing from myself or from Said bin Salim could
convince men who would not be convinced, of that
simple fact. Ismail, the Baloch, who was dying of dysentery,
reported himself unable to proceed: arrangements
were made to leave him and his “brother”
Shahdad&mdash;the fearful tinkling of whose sleepless guitar
argued that the sweet youth was in love&mdash;under the
charge of Snay bin Amir, at Kazeh. Greybeard Mohammed
was sulking with his fellows. He sat apart from
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-382">[382]</span>
them; and complaining that he had not received his portion
of food, came to me for dismissal, which was granted,
but not accepted. The Jemadar required for himself
and the escort a porter per man. When this was
refused, he changed his tactics, and began to lament
bitterly the unavoidable delay. He annoyed me with
ceaseless visits, which were spent in harping upon the
one string, “When do we march?” At last I forbade
all allusion to the subject. In wrath he demanded leave,
declaring that he had not come to settle in Africa, and
much “excessiveness” to the same effect. He was at
last brought to his senses by being summarily turned
out of the house for grossly insulting my companion.
A reaction then ensued; the Baloch professed penitence,
and all declared themselves ready to march or to halt
as I pleased. Yet, simulating impatience to depart, they
clung to the pleasures of Kazeh; they secretly caused
the desertion of the porters, and they never ceased to
spread idle reports, vainly hoping that I might be induced
to return to the coast.</p>

<p>Finally, Said bin Salim fulfilled at Kazeh Lieut.-Col.
Hamerton’s acute prophecy. The Bukini blood of his
mother&mdash;a Malagash slave&mdash;got the better of his Omani
descent. I had long reformed my opinion concerning
his generosity and kindheartedness, hastily concluded
during a short cruise along the coast. “Man’s heart,”
say the Arabs, “is known only in the fray, and man’s
head is known only on the way.” But though high-flown
sentiment and studied courtesy had disappeared
with the first days of hardship and fatigue, he preserved
for a time the semblance of respectability and respect.
Presently, like the viler orders of Orientals, he presumed
upon his usefulness, and his ability to forward
the Expedition; the farther we progressed from our
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-383">[383]</span>
“<i>point d’appui</i>” the coast, the more independent became
his manner,&mdash;of course it afterwards subsided
into its former civility,&mdash;and an overpowering egotism
formed the motive of his every action. I had imprudently
allowed him to be accompanied by the charming
Halimah. True to his servile origin, he never seemed
happy except in servile society, where he was “king of
his company.” At Kazeh, jealous of my regard for
Snay bin Amir, and wearied by long evening conversations,
where a little “ilm” or knowledge in the shape
of history and divinity used to appear,&mdash;his ignorance
and apathy concerning all things but A. bin B., and B.
bin C., who married his son D. to the daughter of E., prevented
his taking part in them,&mdash;he became first sulky,
and then “contrarious.” Formerly he was wont, on
the usual occasions, to address a word of salutation to
my companion: this ceased, and presently he would pass
him as if he had been a bale of cloth. He affected in
society the indecorous posture of a European woman
stretched upon a sofa, after crouching for months upon
his shins,&mdash;in fact he was, as the phrase is, “trailing
his jacket” for a quarrel.</p>

<p>Through timidity he had been profuse in expending
the goods entrusted to his charge, and he had been repeatedly
reproved for serving out, without permission,
cloth and beads to his children. Yet, before reaching
Unyanyembe,I never had reason to suspect him of dishonesty
or deceit. At Kazeh, however, he was ordered
to sell a keg of gunpowder, before his slaves could purloin
the whole. He reported that he had passed on
the commission to Snay bin Amir. I also forbade him
to issue hire to porters for a return-march from the
Lake, having been informed that such was the best way
to secure their desertion; and the information proved
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-384">[384]</span>
true enough, as twenty-five disappeared in a single
night. He repeatedly affirmed that he had engaged
and paid them for the up-march only. When he stood
convicted of a double falsehood, he had <i>not</i> spoken
about the gunpowder, and he <i>had</i> issued whole hire to
several of the porters, I improved the occasion with a
mild reproach. The little creature became vicious as
a weasel, screamed like a hyæna, declared himself no
tallab or “asker,” but an official under his government,
and poured forth a torrent of justification. I
cut the same short by leaving the room&mdash;a confirmed
slight in these lands&mdash;and left him to rough language
on the part of Snay bin Amir. Some hours subsequently
he recovered his temper, and observed that
“even husband and wife must occasionally have a gird
at each other.” Not caring, however, for a repetition
of such puerilities, I changed the tone of kindness in
which he had invariably been addressed, for one of
routine command, and this was preserved till the day
of our final parting on the coast.</p>

<p>The good Snay bin Amir redoubled his attentions.
His slaves strung in proper lengths, upon the usual
palm-fibre, the beads sent up loose from Zanzibar; and
he distributed the bales in due proportions for carriage.
Our lights being almost exhausted, he made for us
“dips,” by ladling over wicks of unravelled “domestics”
the contents of a cauldron filled with equal
parts of hot wax and tallow. My servant, Valentine,
who, evincing uncommon aptitude for cooking, had as
yet acquired only that wretched art of burlesquing
coarse English dishes which renders the table in Western
India a standing mortification to man’s palate, was
apprenticed to Mama Khamisi, a buxom housekeeper
in Snay’s establishment. There, in addition to his
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-385">[385]</span>
various Goanese accomplishments&mdash;making curds and
whey, butter, cheese, and ghee; potting fish, pickling
onions and limes, and preparing jams and jelly
from the pleasant and cooling rosel,&mdash;he learned the
art of yeasting bread with whey or sour bean-flour
(his leathery scones of coarse meal were an abomination
to us); of straining honey, of preparing the favourite
“Kawurmeh,” jerked or smoked meat chipped up and
soused in ghee; of making Firni, rice-jelly, and Halwa,
confectionery, in the shape of “Kazi’s luggage,” and
“hand-works:” he was taught to make ink from
burnt grain; and last, not least, the trick of boiling
rice as it should be boiled. We, in turn, taught him
the various sciences of bird-stuffing, of boiling down
isinglass and ghee, of doctoring tobacco with plantain,
heeart, and tea leaves, and of making milk-punch, cigars,
and guraku for the hookah. Snay bin Amir also sent into
the country for plantains and tamarinds, then unprocurable
at Kazeh, and he brewed a quantity of beer and
mawa or plantain-wine. He admonished the Baloch
and the sons of Ramji to be more careful, as regards
conduct and expenditure. He lent me valuable
assistance in sketching the outlines of the Kinyamwezi,
or language of Unyamwezi, and by his distances and
directions we were enabled to lay down the Southern
limits, and the general shape of the Nyanza or Northern
Lake, as correctly&mdash;and the maps forwarded from Kazeh
to the Royal Geographical Society will establish this fact&mdash;as
they were subsequently determined, after actual
exploration, by my companion. He took charge of our
letters and papers intended for home, and he undertook
to forward the lagging gang still expected from the
Coast: as the future will prove, his energy enabled me to
receive the much wanted reserve in the “nick of time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-386">[386]</span></p>

<p>At length, it became apparent that no other porters
were procurable at Kazeh, and that the restiff Baloch
and the sons of Ramji disdaining Cæsar’s “ite,” required
his “venite.” I therefore resolved to lead them, instead
of expending time and trouble in driving them, trusting
that old habit, and that the difficulties attending their
remaining behind would induce them to follow me.
After much murmuring, my companion preceded me on
the 5th December, and “made a Khambi,” at Zimbili,
a lumpy hill, with a north and south lay, and conspicuous
as a landmark from the Arab settlements,
which are separated from it by a march of two hours.
On the third day I followed him, in truth, more dead
than alive,&mdash;the wing of Azrael seemed waving over my
head,&mdash;even the movement of the Manchila was almost
unendurable. I found cold and comfortless quarters in a
large village at the base of Zimbili, no cartel was procurable,
the roof leaked, and every night brought with it
a furious storm of lightning, wind, and rain. By slow
degrees, the Baloch began to drop in, a few of the
sons of Ramji, and the donkey-men followed, half-a-dozen
additional porters were engaged, and I was
recovering strength to advance once more, when the
report that our long-expected caravan was halted at
Rubuga, in consequence of desertion, rendered a
further delay necessary. My companion returned to
Kazeh, to await the arrival of the reserve-supplies, and
I proceeded onwards to collect a gang for the journey
westwards.</p>

<p>At 10 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>, on the 15th December, I mounted the
Manchila, carried by six slaves, hired by Snay bin
Amir, from Khamis bin Salim at the rate of three
pounds of white beads each, for the journey to Msene.
After my long imprisonment, I was charmed with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-387">[387]</span>
prospect, a fine open country, with well-wooded hills
rolling into blue distance on either hand. A two
hours’ ride placed me at Yombo, a new and picturesque
village of circular tents, surrounded by plantains and
wild fruit-trees. The Mkuba bears an edible red plum,
which, though scanty of flesh, as usual, where man’s
care is wanting, was found by no means unpalatable.
The Metrongoma produces a chocolate-coloured fruit,
about the size of a cherry: it is eaten, but it lacks the
grateful acid of the Mkuba. The gigantic Palmyra or
Borassus, which failed in the barren platform of Ugogo,
here re-appears, and hence extends to the Tanganyika
Lake.</p>

<p>I halted two days at Yombo: the situation was low
and unhealthy, and provisions were procurable in
homœopathic quantities. My only amusement there
was to watch the softer part of the population. At
eventide, when the labours of the day were past and
done, the villagers came home in a body, laden with
their implements of cultivation, and singing a kind of
“dulce domum,” in a simple and pleasing recitative.
The sunset hour, in the “Land of the Moon,” is
replete with enjoyments. The sweet and balmy breeze
floats in waves, like the draught of a fan; the sky is
softly and serenely blue; the fleecy clouds, stationary in
the upper firmament, are robed in purple and gold, and
the beautiful blush, crimsoning the west, is reflected
by all the features of earth. At this time, all is life.
The vulture soars with silent flight, high in the blue
expanse; the small birds preen themselves for the night,
and sing their evening hymns; the antelopes prepare to
couch in the bush; the cattle and flocks frisk and
gamble, whilst driven from their pastures; and the
people busy themselves with the simple pleasures that
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-388">[388]</span>
end the day. Every evening there is a smoking party,
which particularly attracts my attention. All the feminine
part of the population, from wrinkled grandmother
to the maiden scarcely in her teens, assemble together,
and sitting in a circle upon dwarf stools and logs of
wood, apply themselves to their long black-bowl’d pipes.</p>

<p class="noindent">They smoke with an intense enjoyment, slowly and
deeply inhaling the glorious weed, and exhaling clouds
from their nostrils; at times they stop to cool the
mouth with slices of raw manioc, or cobs of green
maize roasted in the ashes; and often some earnest matter
of local importance causes the pipes to be removed
for a few minutes, and a clamour of tongues breaks the
usual silence. The pipe also requires remark: the bowl
is of imperfect material&mdash;the clay being half-baked&mdash;but
the shape is perfect. The African tapering cone is
far superior to the European bowl: the former gives as
much smoke as possible whilst the tobacco is fresh and
untainted, and as little when it becomes hot and unpleasant;
the latter acts on the contrary principle.
Amongst the fair of Yombo, there were no less than
three beauties&mdash;women who would be deemed beautiful
in any part of the world. Their faces were purely
Grecian; they had laughing eyes, their figures were
models for an artist, <span class="nowrap">with&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="noindent">like the “bending statue that delights the world”
cast in bronze. The dress&mdash;a short kilt of calabash
fibre,&mdash;rather set off than concealed their charms, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-389">[389]</span>
though destitute of petticoat or crinoline they were
wholly unconscious of indecorum. It is a question that
by no means can be positively answered in the affirmative,
that real modesty is less in proportion to the absence
of toilette. These “beautiful domestic animals”
graciously smiled when in my best Kinyamwezi I did
my devoir to the sex; and the present of a little
tobacco always secured for me a seat in the undress
circle.</p>

<p>After hiring twenty porters&mdash;five lost no time in
deserting&mdash;and mustering the Baloch, of whom eleven
now were present, I left Yombo on the 18th December,
and passing through a thick green jungle, with low,
wooded, and stony hills rising on the left hand, to about
4000 feet above sea-level, I entered the little settlement
of Pano. The next day brought us to the
clearing of Mfuto, a broad, populous, and fertile rolling
plain, where the stately tamarind flourished to perfection.
A third short march, through alternate patches
of thin wood and field, studded with granite blocks, led
to Irora, a village in Western Mfuto, belonging to Salim
bin Salih, an Arab from Mbuamaji, and a cousin of
Said bin Mohammed, my former travelling companion,
who had remained behind at Kazeh. This individual,
a fat, pulpy, and dingy-coloured mulatto, appeared
naked to the waist, and armed with bow and arrows: he
received me surlily, and when I objected to a wretched
cow-shed outside his palisade, he suddenly waxed
furious: he raved like a madman, shook his silly bow, and
declared that he ignored the name of the Sayyid Majid,
being himself as good a “Sultan” as any other. He
became pacified on perceiving that his wrath excited
nothing but the ridicule of the Baloch, found a better
lodging, sent a bowl of fresh milk wherein to drown
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-390">[390]</span>
differences, and behaved on this and a subsequent occasion
more like an Arab Shaykh, than an African
headman.</p>

<p>On the 22nd December my companion rejoined me,
bringing four loads of cloth, three of beads, and seven
of brass wire: they formed part of the burden of the
twenty-two porters who were to join the Expedition ten
days after its departure from the coast. The Hindus,
Ladha Damha and Mr. Rush Ramji, after the decease of
Lieut.-Colonel Hamerton, had behaved with culpable
neglect. The cloth was of the worst and flimsiest description;
the beads were the cheap white and the useless
black&mdash;the latter I was obliged to throw away; and
as they sent up the supply without other guard than two
armed slaves, “Mshindo” and “Kirikhota,” the consequence
was that the pair had plundered <i>ad libitum</i>. No
letters had been forwarded, and no attention had been
paid to my repeated requests for drugs and other stores.
My companion’s new gang, levied at Kazeh, affected the
greatest impatience. They refused to halt for a day,&mdash;even
Christmas day. They proposed double marches, and
they resolved to proceed by the straight road to Msene.
It was deemed best to humour them. They arrived,
however, at their destination only one day before my
party, who travelled leisurely, and who followed the
longer and the more cultivated route.</p>

<p>We left Irora on the 23rd December, and marched from
sunrise till noon to the district of Eastern Wilyankuru.
There we again separated. On the next day I passed
alone through the settlement called Muinyi Chandi,
where certain Arabs from Oman had built large Tembe,
to serve as barracoons and warehouses. This district
supplies the adjoining countries with turmeric, of which
very little grows in Unyanyembe. After this march disappeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-391">[391]</span>
the last of the six hammals who had been hired
to carry the hammocks. They were as unmanageable
as wild asses, ever grumbling and begging for “kitoweyo,”&mdash;“kitchen;”&mdash;constitutionally
unfitted to obey
an order; disposed, as the noble savage generally is, to be
insolent; and, like all porters in this part of the world,
unable to carry a palanquin. Two men, instead of four,
insisted upon bearing the hammock; thus overburdened
and wishing to get over the work, they hurried
themselves till out of breath. When one was fagged,
the man that should have relieved him was rarely to be
found, consequently two or three stiff trudges knocked
them up and made them desert. Said bin Salim, the
Jemadar, and the Baloch, doubtlessly impressed with
the belief that my days were numbered, passed me on
the last march without a word&mdash;the sun was hot, and
they were hastening to shade&mdash;and left me with only
two men to carry the hammock, in a dangerous strip of
jungle where, shortly afterwards, Salim bin Masud, an
Arab merchant of Msene, was murdered.</p>

<p>On Christmas day I again mounted ass, and passing
through the western third of the Wilyankuru district,
was hospitably received by a wealthy proprietor, Salim
bin Said, surnamed, probably on account of his stature,
Simba, or the Lion, who had obtained from the Sultan
Mrorwa permission to build a large Tembe. The worthy
and kind-hearted Arab exerted himself strenuously to
promote the comfort of his guest. He led me to a comfortable
lodging, placed a new cartel in the coolest room,
supplied meat, milk, and honey, and spent the evening
in conversation with me. He was a large middle-aged
man, with simple, kindly manners, and an honesty of
look and words which rendered his presence exceedingly
prepossessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-392">[392]</span></p>

<p>After a short and eventless march, on the 26th December,
to Masenge, I reached on the following day the
little clearing of Kirira. I was unexpectedly welcomed
by two Arabs, Masud ibn Musallam el Wardi, and Hamid
bin Ibrahim el Amuri. The former, an old man of the
Beni Bu Ali clan, and personally familiar with Sir Lionel
Smith’s exploits, led me into the settlement, which was
heaped round with a tall green growth of milkbush, and
placed me upon a cartel in the cool and spacious barzah
or vestibule of the Tembe. From my vantage-ground I
enjoyed the pleasant prospect of those many little miseries
which Orientals&mdash;perhaps not only Orientals&mdash;create
for themselves by “ceremony” and “politeness.” Weary
and fagged by sun and dust, the Baloch were kept standing
for nearly half an hour before the preliminaries to
sitting down could be arranged and the party could be
marshalled in proper order,&mdash;the most honourable man
on the left hand of the host, and the “lower class” off
the dais or raised step;&mdash;and, when they commenced to
squat, they reposed upon their shins, and could not remove
their arms or accoutrements till especially invited
to hang them up. Hungry and thirsty, they dared not
commit the solecism of asking for food or drink; they
waited from 9 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> till noon, sometimes eyeing the door
with wistful looks, but generally affecting an extreme
indifference as to feeding. At length came the meal, a
mountain of rice, capped with little boulders of mutton.
It was allowed to cool long before precedence round the
tray was settled, and ere the grace, “Bismillah,”&mdash;the
signal to “set to,”&mdash;was reverentially asked by Said bin
Salim. Followed a preparation of curdled milk, for which
spoons being requisite, a wooden ladle did the necessary.
There was much bustling and not a little importance about
Hamid, the younger host, a bilious subject twenty-four or
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-393">[393]</span>
twenty-five years old, who for reasons best known to himself
assumed the style and title of Sarkal,&mdash;Government servant.
The meal concluded with becoming haste, and was
followed by that agreeable appearance of repletion which
is so pleasing to the Oriental Amphitryon. The Baloch
returned to squat upon their shins, and they must have
suffered agonies till 5 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, when the appearance of a
second and a more ceremonious repast enabled them once
more to perch upon their heels. It was hard eating
this time; the shorwa, or mutton broth, thickened with
melted butter, attracted admiration; the guests, however,
could only hint at its excellences, because in the East
if you praise a man’s meat you intend to slight his society.
The <i>plat de résistance</i> was, as usual, the pillaw,
or, as it is here called, pulao,&mdash;not the conventional mess
of rice and fowl, almonds and raisins, onion-shreds, cardomoms,
and other abominations, which goes by that
name amongst Anglo-Indians, but a solid heap of rice,
boiled after being greased with a handful of <span class="nowrap">ghee&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(I must here indulge in a little digression. For the past
century, which concluded with reducing India to the
rank of a British province, the proud invader has eaten
her rice after a fashion which has secured for him the contempt
of the East. He deliberately boils it, and after
drawing off the nutritious starch or gluten called “conjee,”
which forms the perquisite of his Portuguese or his
Pariah cook, he is fain to fill himself with that which has
become little more nutritious than the prodigal’s husks.
Great, indeed, is the invader’s ignorance upon that point.
Peace be to the manes of Lord Macaulay, but listen to and
wonder at his eloquent words!&mdash;“The Sepoys came to
Clive, not to complain of their scanty fare, but to propose
that all the grain should be given to the Europeans, who
required more nourishment than the natives of Asia. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-394">[394]</span>
thin gruel, they said, which was strained away from the
rice would suffice for themselves. History contains no
more touching instance of military fidelity, or of the
influence of a commanding mind.” Indians never fail
to drink the “conjee.” The Arab, on the other hand,
mingles with his rice a sufficiency of ghee to prevent
the extraction of the “thin gruel,” and thus makes the
grain as palatable and as nutritious as Nature intended
it to be.)</p>

<p>&mdash;and dotted over with morsels of fowl, so boiled that
they shredded like yarn under the teeth. This repast
again concluded with a bowl of sweetened milk, and
other entremets, for which both hosts amply apologised;
the house had lately been burned down, and
honey had been used instead of sugar. The day concluded
with prayers, with a seance in the verandah
and with drinking fresh milk out of gourds&mdash;a state of
things which again demanded excuses. A multitude of
“Washenzi” thronged into the house, especially during
the afternoon, to gaze at the Muzungu. I was formally
presented to the Sultan Kafrira, a tall and wrinkled elder,
celebrated for ready wits and spear. The sons of
Ramji had often looked in at the door whilst preparations
for feeding were going on, but they were not asked
to sit down: the haughty host had provided them with
a lean goat, in return for which they privily expressed
an opinion that he was a “dog.” Masud, boasting of
his intimacy with the Sultan Msimbira, whose subjects
had plundered our portmanteau, offered on return to
Unyanyembe his personal services in ransoming it.
I accepted with joy; but the Shaykh Masud, as afterwards
proved, nearly “left his skin” in the undertaking.</p>

<p>The climate of Kíríra is called by the Arabs a medicine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-395">[395]</span>
They vaunt its virtues, which become apparent
after the unhealthy air of Kazeh, and after a delicious
night spent in the cool barzah, I had no reason to question
its reputation. I arose in the morning wonderfully
refreshed, and Valentine, who had been prostrated
with fever throughout the day, became another man. Yet
the situation was apparently unpropitious; the Gombe
Nullah, the main drain of this region, a line of stagnant
pools, belted with almost impassable vegetation, lies
hard by, and the background is an expanse of densest
jungle.</p>

<p>Three short and eventless marches through thick
jungle, with scattered clearings, led me, on the 30th
December, to the district of Msene, where the dense
wild growth lately traversed suddenly opens out and
discloses to the west a broad view of admirable fertility.
Before entering the settlements, the caravan halted, as
usual, to form up. We then progressed with the usual
pomp and circumstance; the noise was terrific, and the
streets, or rather the spaces between the houses, were
lined with Negroid spectators. I was led to the Tembe
of one Saadullah, a low-caste Msawahili, and there
found my companion looking but poorly. Gaetano, his
“boy,” was so excited by the scene, that he fell down
in a fit closely resembling epilepsy.</p>

<p>Msene, the chief Bandari of Western Unyamwezi, may
be called the capital of the Coast Arabs and the Wasawahili,
who, having a natural antipathy to their brethren
of Oman, have abandoned to them Unyanyembe and its
vicinity. Of late years, however, the Omani merchants,
having been driven from the neighbouring districts by
sundry murders into Msene, may at times be met there
to the number of four or five. The inhabitants are
chiefly Wasumbwá, a subtribe of the Wanyamwezi race.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-396">[396]</span>
There is, however, besides Arabs and Wasawahili, a
large floating population of the pastoral clan called
Watosi, and fugitives from Uhha. In 1858 the chief of
Msene was the Sultan Masanza. Both he and Funza, his
brother, were hospitable and friendly to travellers, especially
to the Arabs, who but a few years ago beat off
with their armed slaves a large plundering party of the
ferocious Watuta. This chief has considerable power, and
the heads of many criminals elevated upon poles in front
of his several villages show that he rules with a firm
hand. He is never approached by a subject without
the clapping of hands and the kneeling which in these
lands are the honours paid to royalty. He was a large-limbed,
gaunt, and sinewy old man, dressed in a dirty
Subai or Arab check, over a coating of rancid butter, with
a broad brass disk, neatly arabesqued, round his neck,
with a multitude of little pigtails where his head was
not bald, and with some thirty sambo or flexible wire
rings deforming, as if by elephantiasis, his ankles. Like
the generality of sultans, he despises beads as an article
of decoration, preferring coils of brass or copper. He
called several times at the house occupied by the Expedition,
and on more than one occasion brought with him
a bevy of wives, whose deportment was, I regret to say,
rather naïve than decorous.</p>

<p>Msene, like Unyanyembe, is not a town, but a mass
of detached settlements, which are unconscious of a regular
street. To the northwards lie the villages of the
Sultan&mdash;Kwihángá and Yovu. These are surrounded
with a strong stockade, a deep moat, and a thick milk-bush
hedge, intended for defence. The interior is occupied
by thatched circular huts, divided by open
squarelike spaces, and wynds and alleys are formed by
milk-bush hedges and palisades. There are distinct
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-397">[397]</span>
places for the several wives, families, and slaves. The
other settlements&mdash;Mbugání (“in the wild”) and Mji Mpia
(“new town”), the latter being the place affected by the
Wasawahili&mdash;cluster in a circle, separated by short cross-roads,
which after rain are ankle-deep in mud, from
Chyámbo, the favourite locale of the Coast Arabs. This
settlement, which contained in 1858 nine large Tembe
and about 150 huts, boasts of an African attempt at a
soko or bazar, a clear space between the houses, where,
in fine weather, bullocks are daily slaughtered for food,
and where grain, vegetables, and milk are exposed for
sale. At Msene a fresh outfit of cloth, beads, and wire
can be procured for a price somewhat higher than at
Unyanyembe. The merchants have small stores of
drugs and spices, and sometimes a few comforts, as
coffee, tea, and sugar. The latter is generally made of
granulated honey, and therefore called sukárí zá ásalí.
The climate of Msene is damp, the neighbouring hills
and the thickly-vegetated country attracting an abundance
of rain. It is exceedingly unhealthy, the result
doubtless of filth in the villages and stagnant waters
spread over the land. The Gombe Nullah, which runs
through the district, about six hours’ march from
the settlements, discharges after rain its superfluous
contents into the many lakelets, ponds, and swamps of
the lowlands. Fertilised by a wet monsoon, whose floods
from the middle of October to May are interrupted only
by bursts of fervent heat, the fat, black soil manured by
the decay of centuries, reproduces abundantly anything
committed to it. Flowers bloom spontaneously over
the flats, and trees put forth their richest raiment. Rice
of the red quality&mdash;the white is rare and dear&mdash;grows
with a density and a rapidity unknown in Eastern Unyamwezi.
Holcus and millet, maize and manioc, are
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-398">[398]</span>
plentiful enough to be exported. Magnificent palmyras,
bauhinias and sycomores, plantains, and papaws, and a
host of wild fruit-trees, especially the tamarind, which
is extensively used, adorn the land. The other productions
are onions, sweet potatoes, and egg-plants, which
are cultivated; turmeric, brought from the vicinity;
tomatos and bird-pepper, which grow wild; pulse,
beans, pumpkins, water-melons, excellent mushrooms,
and edible fungi. Milk, poultry, honey, and tobacco
are cheap and plentiful. The currency at Msene in
1858&mdash;the date is specified, as the medium is liable to
perpetual and sudden change, often causing severe losses
to merchants, who, after laying in a large outfit of
certain beads, find them suddenly unfashionable, and
therefore useless&mdash;was the “pipe-stem,” white and blue
porcelain-beads, called sofi in the string, and individually
msaro. Of these ten were sufficient to purchase
a pound of beef. The other beads in demand were the
sungomaji, or pigeon-egg, the red-coral, the pink-porcelain,
and the shell-decorations called kiwangwa. The
cheaper varieties may be exchanged for grain and
vegetables, but they will not purchase fowls, milk, and
eggs. At this place only, the palmyra is tapped for
toddy; in other parts of East Africa the people are unable
to climb it. The market at Msene is usually somewhat
cheaper than that of Unyanyembe, but at times
the prices become very exorbitant.</p>

<p>The industry of Msene is confined to manufacturing
a few cotton cloths, coarse mats, clay pipeheads, and
ironmongery. As might be expected from the constitution
of its society, Msene is a place of gross debauchery,
most grateful to the African mind. All, from
sultan to slave, are intoxicated whenever the material
is forthcoming, and the relations between the sexes are
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-399">[399]</span>
of the loosest description. The drum is never silent,
and the dance fills up the spare intervals of carouse,
till exhausted nature can no more. The consequence
is, that caravans invariably lose numbers by desertion
when passing through Msene. Even household slaves,
born and bred upon the coast, cannot tear themselves
from its Circean charms.</p>

<p>There was “cold comfort” at Msene, where I was
delayed twelve days. The clay roof of the Tembe
was weed-grown like a deserted grave, and in the foul
patio or central court-yard only dirty puddles set in
black mud met the eye. The weather was what only
they can realise who are familiar with a “Rainy
Monsoon.” The temptations of the town rendered it
almost impossible to keep a servant or a slave within
doors; the sons of Ramji vigorously engaged themselves
in trading, and Muinyi Wazira in a debauch, which
ended in his dismissal. Gaetano had repeated epileptic
fits, and Valentine rushed into the room half-crying to
show a white animalcule&mdash;in this country called Funza&mdash;which
had lately issued from his “buff.” None of
the half-caste Arabs, except I’d and Khalfan, sons of
Muallim Salim, the youths who had spread evil reports
concerning us in Ugogo and elsewhere, called or showed
any civility, and the only Arab at that time resident at
Msene was the old Salim bin Masud. I received several
visits from the Sultan Masanza. His first greeting
was, “White man, what pretty thing hast thou brought
up from the shore for me?” He presented a bullock, and
received in return several cloths and strings of beads, and
he introduced to us a variety of princesses, who returned
the salutes of the Baloch and others with a wild effusion.
As Christmas-day had been spent in marching, I
hailed the opportunity of celebrating the advent of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-400">[400]</span>
New Year. Said bin Salim, the Jemadar, and several
of the guard, were invited to an English dinner on a
fair sirloin of beef, and a curious succedaneum for a
plum-pudding, where neither flour nor currants were to
be found. A characteristic trait manifested itself on
this occasion. Amongst Arabs, the remnants of a feast
must always be distributed to the servants and slaves of
the guests;&mdash;a “brass knocker” would lose a man’s
reputation. Knowing this, I had ordered the Goanese
to do in Rome as the Romans do; and being acquainted
with their peculiarities, I paid them an unexpected visit,
where they were found so absorbed in the task of hiding,
under pots and pans, every better morsel from a crowd
of hungry peerers that the interruption of a stick was
deemed necessary.</p>

<p>At length, on the 10th January, 1858, I left Msene
with considerable difficulty. The Kirangozi, or guide,
who had promised to accompany me, had sent an incompetent
substitute, his brother, a raw young lad, who
had no power to collect porters. The sons of Ramji
positively refused to lend their aid in strengthening
the gang. One of Said bin Salim’s children, the boy
Faraj, had fled to Kazeh. The bull-headed Mabruki
was brought back from flight only by the persuasion of
his brother “Bombay,” and even “Bombay,” under
the influence of some negroid Neæra, at the time of departure
hid himself in his hut. All feared the march
westwards. A long strip of blue hill lying northwards
ever keeps the traveller in mind of the robber Watuta,
and in places where the clans are mixed, all are
equally hostile to strangers. Villages are less frequented
and more meanly built, and caravans are not admitted
beyond the faubourgs&mdash;the miserable huts outlying the
fences. The land also is most unhealthy. After the
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-401">[401]</span>
rain, the rich dark loam becomes, like the black soils of
Guzerat and the Deccan, a coat of viscid mire. Above is
a canopy of cumulus and purple nimbus, that discharge
their loads in copious day-long floods. The vegetation
is excessive, and where there is no cultivation a dense
matting of coarse grass, laid by wind and water and decayed
by mud, veils the earth, and from below rises a
clammy chill, like the thaw-cold of England, the effect of
extreme humidity. And, finally, the paths are mere
lines, pitted with deep holes, and worn by cattle
through the jungle.</p>

<p>After an hour and thirty minutes’ march I entered
Mb’hali, the normal cultivator’s village in Western Unyamwezi;&mdash;a
heap of dwarf huts like inverted birds’ nests
surrounding a central space, and surrounded by giant
heaps of euphorbia or milk-bush. Tall grasses were
growing almost up to the door-ways, and about the settlement
were scattered papaws and plantains; the
Mwongo, with its damson-like fruit, the Mtogwe or wood-apple
tree, and the tall solitary Palmyra, whose high
columnar stem, with its graceful central swell, was eminently
attractive. We did not delay at Mb’hali, whence
provisions had been exhausted by the markets of Msene.
The 11th January led us through a dense jungle upon
a dead flat, succeeded by rolling ground bordered with
low hills and covered with alternate bush and cultivation,
to Sengati, another similar verdure-clad village of
peasantry, where rice and other supplies were procurable.
On the 12th January, after passing over a dead
flat of fields and of the rankest grass, we entered rolling
ground in the vicinity of the Gombe Nullah, with scattered
huts upon the rises, and villages built close to the
dense vegetation bordering upon the stream. Sorora or
Solola is one of the deadliest spots in Unyamwezi; we
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-402">[402]</span>
were delayed there, however, three long days, by the
necessity of collecting a two months’ supply of rice,
which is rarely to be obtained further west.</p>

<p>The non-appearance of the sons of Ramji rendered
it necessary to take a strong step. I could ill afford the
loss of twelve guns, but Kidogo and his men had become
insufferable: moreover, they had openly boasted
that they intended to prevent my embarking upon the
“Sea of Ujiji.” Despite therefore the persuasions of
the Jemadar and Said bin Salim, who looked as if
they had heard their death-warrants, I summoned the
slaves, who first condescended to appear on the 13th
January&mdash;three days after my departure,&mdash;informed
them that the six months for which they were engaged
and paid had expired, and that they had better
return and transact their proprietor’s business at Kazeh.
They changed, it is true, their tone and manner, pathetically
pleaded, as an excuse for their ill conduct, that
they were slaves, and promised in future to be the most
obedient of servants. But they had deceived me too
often, and I feared that, if led forwards, they might
compromise the success of the exploration. They were
therefore formally dismissed, with a supply of cloth and
beads sufficient to reach Kazeh, a letter to their master,
and another paper to Snay bin Amir, authorising him
to frank them to their homes. Kidogo departed, declaring
that he would carry off perforce, if necessary,
the four donkey-drivers who had been engaged and
paid for the journey to the “Sea of Ujiji” and back:
as two of these men, Nasibu and Hassani, openly threatened
to desert, they were at once put in irons and
entrusted to the Baloch. They took oaths on the
Koran, and, by strong swearing, persuaded Said bin
Salim and their guard to obtain my permission for
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-403">[403]</span>
their release. I gave it unwillingly, and on the next
march they “levanted,” carrying off, as runaway slaves
are wont to do, a knife, some cloth, and other necessaries
belonging to Sangora, a brother donkey-driver. Sangora
returning without leave, to recover his goods, was seized,
tied up, and severely fustigated by the inexorable Kidogo,
for daring to be retained whilst he himself was
dismissed.</p>

<p>The Kirangozi and Bombay having rejoined at Sorora,
the Expedition left it on the 16th January. Traversing
a fetid marsh, the road plunged into a forest,
and crossed a sharp elbow of the Gombe Nullah, upon
whose grassy and reedy banks lay a few dilapidated
“baumrinden” canoes, showing that at times the bed
becomes unfordable. Having passed that night at
Ukungwe, and the next at Panda, dirty little villages,
where the main of the people’s diet seemed to be
mushrooms resembling ours and a large white fungus
growing over the grassy rises, on the 18th January we
entered Kajjanjeri.</p>

<p>Kajjanjeri appeared in the shape of a circle of round
huts. Its climate is ever the terror of travellers: to
judge from the mud and vegetation covering the floors,
the cultivators of the fields around usually retire to
another place during the rainy season. Here a formidable
obstacle to progress presented itself. I had been
suffering for some days: the miasmatic air of Sorora
had sown the seeds of fresh illness. About 3 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, I
was obliged to lay aside the ephemeris by an unusual
sensation of nervous irritability, which was followed by
a general shudder as in the cold paroxysm of fevers.
Presently the extremities began to weigh and to burn
as if exposed to a glowing fire, and a pair of jack-boots,
the companions of many a day and night, became too
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-404">[404]</span>
tight and heavy to wear. At sunset, the attack had
reached its height. I saw yawning wide to receive me</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<span class="verse indent4">“those dark gates across the wild<br /></span>
<span class="verse indent0">That no man knows.”<br /></span>
</div><!--stanza-->

</div><!--poetry-container-->

<p class="noindent">The whole body was palsied, powerless, motionless,
and the limbs appeared to wither and die; the feet had
lost all sensation, except a throbbing and tingling, as if
pricked by a number of needle points; the arms refused
to be directed by will, and to the hands the touch of
cloth and stone was the same. Gradually the attack
seemed to spread upwards till it compressed the ribs;
there, however, it stopped short.</p>

<p>This, at a distance of two months from medical aid,
and with the principal labour of the Expedition still in
prospect! However, I was easily consoled. Hope, says
the Arab, is woman, Despair is man. If one of us was
lost, the other might survive to carry home the results
of the exploration. I had undertaken the journey in the
“nothing-like-leather” state of mind, with the resolve
either to do or die. I had done my best, and now
nothing appeared to remain for me but to die as well.</p>

<p>Said bin Salim, when sent for, declared, by a “la
haul!” the case beyond his skill; it was one of partial
paralysis brought on by malaria, with which the
faculty in India are familiar. The Arab consulted
a Msawahili Fundi, or caravan-guard, who had joined
us on the road, and this man declared that a similar
accident had once occurred to himself and his little party
in consequence of eating poisoned mushrooms. I tried
the usual remedies without effect, and the duration of
the attack presently revealed what it was. The contraction
of the muscles, which were tightened like ligatures
above and below the knees, and those λυτα γουνατα,
a pathological symptom which the old Greek loves to
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-405">[405]</span>
specify, prevented me from walking to any distance for
nearly a year; the numbness of the hands and feet
disappeared even more slowly. The Fundi, however,
successfully predicted that I should be able to move in
ten days&mdash;on the tenth I again mounted my ass.</p>

<p>This unforeseen misfortune detained the caravan
at Kajjanjeri till porters could be procured for the
hammock. On the 21st January four men were with
difficulty persuaded to carry me over the first march to
Usagozi. This gang was afterwards increased to six
men, who severally received six cloths for the journey
to Ujiji; they all “bolted” eight days after their engagement,
and before completing half the journey. These
men were sturdier than the former set of Hammals,
but being related to the Sultan of Usagozi, they were
even more boisterous, troublesome, and insolent. One
of them narrowly escaped a pistol bullet; he ceased,
however, stabbing with his dagger at the slave Mabruki
before the extreme measure became necessary.</p>

<p>Usagozi was of old the capital province of Unyamwezi,
and is still one of its principal and most civilised divisions.
Some authorities make Usagozi the western
frontier of Unyamwezi, others place the boundary at
Mukozimo, a few miles to the westward; it is certain,
however, that beyond Usagozi the Wanyamwezi are
but part-proprietors of the soil. The country is laid
out in alternate seams of grassy plains, dense jungle,
and fertile field. The soil is a dark vegetable humus,
which bears luxuriant crops of grain, vegetables, and
tobacco; honey-logs hang upon every large tree, cattle
are sold to travellers, and the people are deterred by the
aspect of a dozen discoloured skulls capping tall poles,
planted in a semicircle at the main entrance of each
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-406">[406]</span>
settlement, from doing violence to caravans. When I
visited Usagozi it was governed by “Sultan Ryombo,”
an old chief “adorned with much Christian courtesy.”
His subjects are Wakalaganza, the noble tribe of the
Wanyamwezi, mixed, however with the Watosi, a fine-looking
race, markedly superior to their neighbours, but
satisfied with leaky, ragged, and filthy huts, and large
but unfenced villages. The general dress of the Wakalaganza
is bark-cloth, stained a dull black.</p>

<p>We halted three days on the western extremity of
the Usagozi district, detained by another unpleasant
phenomenon. My companion, whose blood had been
impoverished, and whose system had been reduced by
many fevers, now began to suffer from “an inflammation
of a low type, affecting the whole of the interior
tunic of the eyes, particularly the iris, the choroid coat,
and the retina;” he describes it as “an almost total
blindness, rendering every object enclouded as by a
misty veil.” The Goanese Valentine became similarly
afflicted, almost on the same day; he complained of a
“drop serene” in the shape of an inky blot&mdash;probably
some of the black pigment of the iris deposited on the
front of the lens&mdash;which completely excluded the light
of day; yet the pupils contracted with regularity when
covered with the hand, and as regularly dilated when it
was removed. I suffered in a minor degree; for a few
days webs of flitting muscæ obscured smaller objects and
rendered distant vision impossible. My companion and
servant, however, subsequently, at Ujiji, were tormented
by inflammatory ophthalmia, which I escaped by the free
use of “camel-medicine.”</p>

<p>Quitting Usagozi on the 26th January, we marched
through grain fields, thick jungle-strips, and low grassy
and muddy savannahs to Masenza, a large and comfortable
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-407">[407]</span>
village of stray Wagara or Wagala, an extensive
tribe, limiting Unyamwezi on the S. and S.E., at the
distance of about a week’s march from the road. On
the 27th January, after traversing cultivation, thick
jungles, and low muddy bottoms of tall grass chequered
with lofty tamarinds, we made the large well-palisadoed
villages of the Mukozimo district, inhabited by a mixture
of Wanyamwezi, with Wagara from the S.E. and
Wawende from the S.W. The headman of one of these
inhospitable “Kaya,” or fenced hamlets, would not
house “men who ride asses.” The next station was
Uganza, a populous settlement of Wawende, who admitted
us into their faubourg, but refused to supply provisions.
The 29th January saw us at the populous and
fertile clearing of Usenye, where the mixed races lying
between the Land of the Moon eastward, and Uvinza
westward, give way to pure Wavinza, who are considered
by travellers even more dangerous than their
neighbours.</p>

<p>Beyond Usenye we traversed a deep jungle where
still lingered remains of villages which had been plundered
and burned down by the Wawende and the Watuta,
whose hills rose clearly defined on the right hand.
Having passed the night at Rukunda, or Lukunda, on
the 31st January we sighted the plain of the Malagarazi
River. Northwards of the road ran the stream,
and the low level of the country adjoining it had converted
the bottoms into permanent beds of soft, deep,
and slippery mire. The rest of the march was the
usual country&mdash;jungle, fields, and grasses&mdash;and after a
toilsome stretch, we unpacked at the settlement of
Wanyika.</p>

<p>At Wanyika we were delayed for a day by the necessity
of settling Kuhonga, or blackmail, with the envoys
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-408">[408]</span>
of Mzogera. This great man, the principal Sultan of
Uvinza, is also the Lord of the Malagarazi River. As
he can enforce his claims by forbidding the ferrymen
to assist strangers, he must be carefully humoured. He
received about forty cloths, white and blue, six Kitindi
or coil bracelets, and ten Fundo (or 100 necklaces) of
coral beads. It is equivalent in these lands to 50<i>l.</i> in
England. When all the items had been duly palavered
over, we resumed our march on the 2nd February.
The road, following an incline towards the valley of the
river, in which bush and field alternated with shallow
pools, black mud, and putrid grass, led to Unyanguruwwe,
a miserable settlement, producing, however, millet in
abundance, sweet potatoes, and the finest manioc. On
the 3rd February we set out betimes. Spanning cultivation
and undulating grassy ground, and passing over
hill-opens to avoid the deeper swamps, we debouched
from a jungle upon the river-plain, with the swift brown
stream, then about fifty yards broad, swirling through
the tall wet grasses of its banks on our right hand, hard
by the road. Upon the off side a herd of elephants,
forming Indian file, slowly broke through the reed-fence
in front of them: our purblind eyes mistook them for
buffaloes. Northwards lay an expanse of card-table
plain, over which the stream, when in flood, debords to the
distance of two miles, cutting it with deep creeks and
inlets. The flat is bounded in the far offing by a sinuous
line of faint blue hills, the haunts of the Watuta; whilst,
westward and southward, rises the wall-shaped ridge,
stony and wooded, which buttresses the left bank of the
river for some days’ journey down the stream. We
found lodgings for the night in a little village, called
from its district Ugaga; we obtained provisions, and
we lost no time in opening the question of ferryage.
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-409">[409]</span>
The Sultan Mzogera had sold his permission to cross
the river. The Mutware, or Mutwale, the Lord of the
Ferry, now required payment for his canoes.</p>

<p>Whilst delayed at Ugaga by the scabrous question of
how much was to be extracted from me, I will enter into
a few geographical details concerning the Malagarazi
River.</p>

<p>The Malagarazi, corrupted by speculative geographers
to Mdjigidgi,&mdash;the uneuphonious terminology of the
“Mombas Mission Map,”&mdash;to “Magrassie” and to “Magozi,”
has been wrongly represented to issue from the
Sea of Ujiji. According to all travellers in these regions,
it arises in the mountains of Urundi, at no great
distance from the Kitangure, or River of Karagwah; but
whilst the latter, springing from the upper counterslope,
feeds the Nyanza or Northern Lake, the Malagarazi,
rising in the lower slope of the equatorial range, trends
to the south-east, till it becomes entangled in the decline
of the Great Central African Depression&mdash;the hydrographical
basin first indicated in his Address of 1852 by
Sir Roderick I. Murchison, President of the Royal Geographical
Society of London.<a id="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Thence it sweeps round
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-410">[410]</span>
the southern base of Urundi, and, deflected westwards, it
disembogues itself into the Tanganyika. Its mouth is
in the land of Ukaranga, and the long promontory behind
which it discharges its waters, is distinctly visible from
Kawele, the head-quarters of caravans in Ujiji. The
Malagarazi is not navigable; as in primary and transition
countries generally, the bed is broken by rapids.
Beyond the ferry, the slope becomes more pronounced,
branch and channel-islets of sand and verdure divide the
stream, and as every village near the banks appears to
possess one or more canoes, it is probably unfordable.
The main obstacle to crossing it on foot, over the
broken and shallower parts near the rock-bars, would
be the number and the daring of the crocodiles.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote10"></a><a href="#FNanchor10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
The following notice concerning a discovery which must ever be remembered
as a triumph of geological hypothesis, was kindly forwarded to
me by the <span class="nowrap">discoverer:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“My speculations as to the whole African interior being a vast watery
plateau-land of some elevation above the sea, but subtended on the east and
west by much higher grounds, were based on the following <span class="nowrap">data:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“The discovery in the central portion of the Cape colony, by Mr. Bain,
of fossil remains in a lacustrine deposit of secondary age, and the well-known
existence on the coast of loftier mountains known to be of a Palæozoic
or primary epoch and circling round the younger deposits, being followed by
the exploration of the Ngami Lake, justified me in believing that Africa had
been raised from beneath the ocean at a very early geological period; and
that ever since that time the same conditions had prevailed. I thence inferred
that an interior network of lakes and rivers would be found prolonged
northwards from Lake Ngami, though at that time no map was known to
me showing the existence of such central reservoirs. Looking to the
west as well as to the east, I saw no possibility of explaining how the great
rivers could escape from the central plateau-lands and enter the ocean
except through deep lateral gorges, formed at some ancient period of elevation,
when the lateral chains were subjected to transverse fractures. Knowing
that the Niger and the Zaire, or Congo, escaped by such gorges on the
west, I was confident that the same phenomenon must occur upon the eastern
coast, when properly examined. This hypothesis, as sketched out in my
‘Presidential Address’ of 1852, was afterwards received by Dr. Livingstone
just as he was exploring the transverse gorges by which the Zambesi
escapes to the east, and the great traveller has publicly expressed the surprise
he then felt that his discovery should have been thus previously suggested.”</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The Lord of the Ferry delayed us at Ugaga by
removing the canoes till he had extracted fourteen
cloths and one coil-bracelet,&mdash;half his original demand.
Moreover, for each trip the ferryman received from one
to five khete of beads, according to the bulk, weight,
and value of the freight. He was as exorbitant when
we returned; then he would not be satisfied with
less than seven cloths, a large jar of palm oil, and at
least three hundred khete. On the 4th February we
crossed to Mpete, the district on the right or off bank of
the stream. After riding over the river plain, which at
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-411">[411]</span>
that time, when the rains had not supersaturated the
soil, was hard and dry, we came upon the “Ghaut,” a
muddy run or clearing in the thicket of stiff grass which
crossed the stream. There we found a scene of confusion.
The Arabs of Kazeh had described the canoes as fine
barges, capable of accommodating fifty or sixty passengers.
I was not, however, surprised to find wretched
“baumrinden”&mdash;tree-rind&mdash;canoes, two strips of “myombo”
bark, from five to seven feet in length, sown
together like a doubled wedge with fibres of the same
material. The keel was sharp, the bow and stern were
elevated, and the craft was prevented from collapsing by
cross-bars&mdash;rough sticks about eighteen inches long,
jammed ladder-wise between the sides. When high and
dry upon the bank, they look not unlike castaway shoes of
an unusual size. We entered “gingerly.” The craft is
crankier than the Turkish caïque, and we held on “like
grim death” to the gunwale with wetted fingers. The
weight of two men causes these canoes to sink within
three or four inches of water-level. An extra sheet of
stiff bark was placed as a seat in the stern; but the interior
was ankle-deep in water, and baling was necessary
after each trip. The ferryman, standing amidships or
in the fore, poled or paddled according to the depth of
the stream. He managed skilfully enough, and on the
return-march I had reason to admire the dexterity with
which he threaded the narrow, grass-grown and winding
veins of deep water, that ramified from the main
trunk over the swampy and rushy plains on both sides.
Our riding asses were thrown into the river, and they
swam across without accident. Much to my surprise,
none of the bales were lost or injured. The ferrymen
showed decision in maintaining, and ingenuity in increasing,
their claims. On the appearance of opposition
<span class="pagenum" id="Pagei-412">[412]</span>
they poled off to a distance, and squatted, quietly awaiting
the effect of their decisive manœuvre. When the waters
are out, it is not safe to step from the canoe before
it arrives at its destination. The boatman will attempt
to land his passenger upon some dry mound emerging
from deep water, and will then demand a second fee for
salvage.</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
